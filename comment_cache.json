    "I would take some steps before asking for a restraining order; you may be able to resolve the issue. If not, you will have a better foundation on which you can request a restraining order. \n\nMy first step would be to address this separately with your ex-husband. Is there a way that you can safely meet with him in person (if you do it over the phone, his wife will likely be listening and giving her input)? You could explain what is happening and come up with a solution. After you meet, send him a text in writing documenting what you discussed and any solutions you agreed to (this can be used later if necessary). If you are not able to come to an agreement, also document that.\n\nThe next step would be to go to the police. Having a police report will help greatly if you eventually request a restraining order. The police will document the harassment (is she calling you multiple times, is she texting you, is she messaging you on other platforms, is she changing her number or contacting you through multiple accounts, etc.). You can also have the police document the fact that she is following you, and has filed false CPS claims and failed restraining order. You need to have all of your information organized first, including printouts of any harassing messages, any court rulings, any CPS documentation, and a log of dates/times/places where she has been following you (if you don\u2019t have that, start now). The police can advise you if any of her actions arise to the level of criminal charges, and they may have other recommendations for you. Hopefully, they will also conduct some investigation (such as an interview) involving the wife, which will also be documented in the report. This would help you because the involvement of the police may prompt her to end the harassment. Also, the police report would document any potential defenses or explanations the wife has, which will also help you. \n\nOnce you have notified the police and have the police report, you can reassess. Did the police involvement help you at all? Were the police able to charge her with anything? Did the police conduct an investigation and warn her that her behavior could lead to criminal charges? If you are still experiencing the same level harassment, then you can file for a restraining order (which is a criminal proceeding) or potentially you could also file a civil claim for harassment (this will require you to pay for a lawyer). \n\nWhichever route you take, it is very important that you document everything. You must print out any physical records, and you must keep your own records for other significant events so that you are not trying to rely on your recollection alone.": {

The heating system that\u2019s broke is what was included with your lease, not space heaters.\n\nAlso you\u2019ll pay about $40 a month for one (1) 1000w space heater (assuming you do turn it off) you\u2019ll see an absurd increase in utility costs. In CA you can deduct that increase from your rent until they do fix the heating system.\n\nAs for the landlord, I\u2019m kind of shocked they aren\u2019t worried what the plumbing will do if not maintaining sufficient heat in the rental.

During an unpaid meal break not only are you required to not work, but you are not required to stay at your place of business. You can wear whatever you like, go wherever you like, and leave the building. As you are not actively being paid your employer has no jurisdiction about what you do or where you go. If at any point your employer requires you stay, requires you to work, or even stay in uniform (if you have a dress code/ policy) then they have violated your meal break and you are entitled to compensation. I would still recommend looking up the specifics of your exact state but it\u2019s very likely similar.\n\nFrom my experience the compensation given was money paid for working during breaks, as well as overtime as the breaks put the employees into an overtime area of total hours worked. \n\nWith all of that said. It sounds like your director or boss isn\u2019t doing the right thing here, and they very well may push back if you correct them.

If you\u2019ve already mentioned to them that you don\u2019t think what they are doing is right; then I\u2019d strongly recommend making sure that is in writing too. \n\nDepending on how good your relationship status is with your boss/ director it may behoove you to inquire about other prospective job opportunities, not saying they will terminate you for correcting them on your legally entitled breaks and the requirements thereof to constitute a break, but it\u2019s not uncommon. \n\nHope your situation gets better, and that you get your breaks back at work.": {

If you have an infection in your toe and the choice is losing the toe or your foot, you still have to pick even if you don't want to lose either. If you ignore it you're losing the foot or worse. There's nothing inherently wrong with comparisons.\n\nThat out of the way:\n\nHarris can be expected to continue a lot of Biden's policies. I've liked what he's done with student loan forgiveness, the infrastructure bill, and the climate change actions in the IRA. I'd also expect her to continue the work agencies like the FTC have done on antitrust\n\nHowever, it'll take time to see how every policy irons out. For the first bit, she's going to be coming out of Biden's shadow and coming into her own. For instance, she seems to be taking a better stance on Israel/Palestine than Biden did. And before becoming VP, she had an ok record on climate change policies. She's also been consistently vocal about abortion protections.\n\n\nFor a more complete list of things done during the Biden admin, you can check lists like /r/whatbidenhasdone which has a list of things Biden has actually done.

Imagine you're making a \"come here\" gesture with your 2 fingers as if you were trying to touch her belly button from the inside. If you feel a surface that feels like the roof of your mouth, that's the vaginal wall.

We all get along as friends, I chat to him at least once a week about normal friend stuff, he also gets along well with my husband too, which I feel is important.\n\nNormally we meet in a pub and have a few drinks, then we go back to our room. We sit drinking and chatting, my friend and I get gradually closer, and it eventually starts like any sexual encounter - touching, kissing, removing of clothes. Usually it proceeds to oral, at this point my man will or won\u2019t be involved. With actual sex, it\u2019s all the usual MMF porno moves - spit roast, missionary with oral, head off the end of the bed etc. \n\nWe take breaks and we all just kinda lie around chatting, having a drink or a smoke, until eventually things get touchy again.

So\u2026 start with using your fingers and just explore yourself. Close your eyes and focus on what FEELS AMAZING, use visualization and talk deliciously to yourself (even if it\u2019s in your head), this will help build your self esteem and help you feel sexy and powerful.\n\nIt\u2019ll take practice but you\u2019ll get there.\nGet to the point where you can orgasm from fingers alone\n\nNext, understand it may take some extra time to orgasm with your partner but keep trying.\nCommunication is key so you can tell them what YOU like.\n\nDuring penetration, trying a position that allows you to use your fingers. For some women it\u2019s doggy style, me personally I need to be on my back and relaxed so find position that works for you and rub away while your man is penetrating. \n\nIt took me an almost a year to reach orgasms during sex with my partner. I would usually have to finish by myself. It was a mental block, like a vulnerability thing.\n\nI\u2019ve only orgasmed once from oral sex so I use that more as a foreplay to get aroused.\nSex should be fun so don\u2019t over think it and just explore. \nYou can try an anal toy too, sometimes the different sensations from both anal and clitoral stimulation bring me to O sooooo fast\n\nBest of luck and have fun": {

So publicly they would just keep denying/downplaying that anyone was seeing anything. The people insisting they had seen evidence of impossibly advanced aircraft and the government was covering it up were actually right- Just, the coverup wasn't to conceal evidence of aliens from the public, just to conceal our military capabilities from the soviets.": {

People on the internet might cheer when a nazi gets beaten up badly in a video even if that nazi, at that moment, wasn't violent. Or some guy yells at a woman and another guy smacks him down and kicks his ass. And that's understandable. It's only human to find satisfaction when someone gets their deserved comeuppance.\n\nI don't think that's a good model for how to behave in a society, though. There's a reason why in Western countries, violence is usually reserved for the state. Having a court of law settle a dispute and the police and state enforce it is how things hould work.\n\nThere is a problem, however, when the population doesn't perceive the state to deal out punishment or violence justly. If having money, or being white makes it more likely you get away with crimes, and being poor or black makes it more likely to become a victim of violence by the state, then that social contract is broken and some people might come to the conclusion that it's only fair for people to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis is a bad solution, however. We should work to fix institutions like the justice system and police, but the general idea that in a democracy the state has a monopoly on legal violence is a good one. That only works if the population at large trusts the state to use that monopoly wisely, however. At the moment, that isn't the case in many societies.": {

That means cleaning and cooking, washing and drying, and all those other boring tasks that come with living away from his mom, which, as you have pointed out, you're not. Did you notice all his excuses are versions of \"I can do it, but I won't until this thing, that is out of my control, happens\"? Have a talk with him and have him step up, period.\n\nOr just get used to it.": {

    "Especially at a younger age - but I'd say for many people always - it's easy to lose track of what one has and how things can slowly deteriorate over time, step by step. Similar to gaining weight or losing control over something. And you 2 are both very young, I think some commenters forget that, I don't really like the approach of \"Something doesn't fit? Quit.\", if every relationship would go down like that none would last. This doesn't mean endless BS has to be accepted, but I mean the instant jump to it.\n\nWhat I'd do is take a closer look at the pattern that he uses when he responds to you pointing something out and already preparing to go against that. Dodging a question, avoiding it by focusing on another topic or lifting up a negative with a \"but \\[insert positive/reason\\]\" is really common, and I'd advice to already throttle it there, but not in an aggressive way. No one here can tell what is going through his mind and even as a partner that's rarely fully possible, so I'd take it slow and confront him - with the plan in mind - in a way that makes it clear how important that is and what it means to you, but also what the consequences would be if nothing improves or gets worse. For this you can also make a list of things that you provide, what he provides, how you weight them importance wise and show with that how you see both people of the relationship.\n\nIf none of this works or you notices he pushes against you and you don't want to end it there, then it might be a good choice to take a break from the relationship - not where both do whatever, but rather to use the distance to see how it is without each other, mostly that he realizes what value you have. It could be a week, 2 weeks or a month where you live separated and he will start realizing that you are contributing a lot for the life of you 2 while he is not really doing anything, or not enough. Though I would word this carefully since if you don't want to end things completely, you don't want to come across as taking this as an escape and ending things, it's a very emotional topic.": {

    "Well, without pointing fingers here, it seems to me that you both have radically different boundary levels and visions of a relationship. As you said, you are a free spirit, while your boyfriend seems to adhere to a more conservative and insecure vision of a relationship. This doesn't mean you or him are wrong, just, unfortunately, incompatible in this regard. \n\nNow, if your boyfriend is generally controlling like that, making you doubt yourself and creating a need of getting his approval for everything, that might be a serious sign of him having a truly manipulative/controlling behaviour. What I want to point out is, if he is only acting like that when you are surrounded by other people without him around, he might just be insecure in this relationship. That means, something is preventing him from fully trusting that you will be a loyal girlfriend. Deep down, he fears being betrayed, and that makes him act in a sort of hypervigilant and aggressive way. Does that mean it's okay? Hell no! But it is a starting point, if you want to discuss about it. \n\nIf his fear of betrayal leads to behavior that restricts your freedom or induces guilt, then it\u2019s a dynamic that needs addressing, even if it comes from an insecurity.\n\nThe only solution here is either to discuss about his insecurity or find a common ground. Maybe a past relationship left him hurt over a betrayal, who knows? In the end, you both might have to compromise, if you wish to continue further with this relationship. If this is a deal-breaker for you, I understand fully, and you're fully within rights to look for a relationship where you get what you deserve.

    "I really appreciate that perspective. He genuinely didn\u2019t mean for it to be taken so horribly, I told him to be completely transparent even if it hurts me and he was hesitant still. He said he was really scared that he\u2019s falling out of love or that the love was just puppy-love. He told me falling out of love and/or breaking up was the last thing he wants in the world because I\u2019m \u201cthe most perfect girl in the world\u201d for him (his words, genuinely) and he doesn\u2019t want to lose me. Before this hurdle he has been the most affectionate and caring boy ever, we share the same humour and have similar interests so our conversations last for hours without a lull. He calls me beautiful and compliments me and my laugh and my humour and all every chance he gets, I return the compliments when I can (but due to my family history I struggle a bit with affection, he knows I try my best though). I don\u2019t have many friends, if any. My relationship with my family is poorly. I\u2019m even considering, as a second year college student, if college is even for me. Losing him on top of all this might shatter me. Break ups are hard enough as they are, but in my circumstances it might be even harder. If there is a chance of turning this rough patch around I wanna take it, I don\u2019t wanna break up at the first sign of imperfection in the relationship.

Opportunities for harmless pleasures like this will always be within reach in our lives, but remember it\u2019s only harmless if it truly doesn\u2019t harm you or someone else. I think the anxiety it has caused is proof that it wasn\u2019t harmless to you this time, even if it wasn\u2019t morally wrong. \n\n  Use your words to talk your BF and see how he feels. You do have that obligation as partners not to keep secrets from one another. If you\u2019re scared of him judging you for it, (which it sounds like you are) then there may some stuff he is still uncomfortable with in himself or maybe your core values systems don\u2019t line up and that\u2019s okay too! \n\n    Communication is key and being honest about this will do you so much good.

People come here to mostly project their own conflicting feelings or self hatred on others. Keep loving yourself and follow the heart God have you. You\u2019re beautiful and will get through this little interruption! \n\nTo the holier than thou crowd, OP asked for advice not admonishment.

    "Having spent several years on the Reddit divorce forums, I can tell you that every soon-to-be-ex is labeled a narcissit or a covert narcissist, probably because the description is so broad and general it applies to most of us. \n\nIt's helpful to hear what he's done, specifically. (Details are better than a diagnosis.) \n\nYou're saying you're willing to work it out, so I'm assuming that nothing, so far, has been an absolute deal-breaker. \n\nYou say he doesn't listen to you when you express your feelings (i.e. you don't feel heard and he's not validating your feelings), that he avoids you (could be stonewalling, unless it's just over specific subjects), and blame shifts (probabably makes excuses and gets defensive). These things are not at all unsual, especially in younger relationships. They don't teach us how to manage relationships school, so it takes more education and practice to learn how to validate your partner's feelings, ask for space rather than stonewalling, and listen without getting defensive. \n\nI'd recommend figuring out a few things that you 100% need out of your marraige.

Bring these to him and try to stick to statements about how those things make YOU feel, and then ask specifically for what you need:\n\n\"When I share my feelings and you walk away, it makes me feel like you don't care. I really need you to try and listen and validate my feelings, even if you don't agree. I just need to feel heard. I know schools don't teach this stuff, so I'd like us to \\[see a therapist, read a book together, watch relationship videos, download an app for couples, etc.\\] so we can gradually work at getting better at communicating. You're such a great father, husband, and lover (injecting some humor) and 90% of our relationship is awesome! I just want to work on the remaining 10% so we can both be happier and model for our son/daughter what a healthy family looks like. I know you/I didn't have that, but we don't have to make the same mistakes our parents made. We're smart people (appeal to ego), and I think we can do better.\" \n\nIt's important to stroke his ego a bit, because soooo many guys feel like \"nothing I ever do is good enough!\" and so they stop trying. They have to know that SOME things they do ARE good enough. \n\nIf things tip too far in the negative, he'll be more tempted to just cut and run. Don't just focus on the negatives and complain about what he doesn't do. Tell him what he DOES do, what you appreciate, THEN what you need, and show him specifically HOW to meet that need. Men like to fix things, so don't be too general (e.g. \"Therapy twice a week until we get through this.\")  \n\nThen, ask him for what HE needs from you! (And maybe agree to work on his thing if he agrees to yours.) \n\nKeep it positive and light if you can. Maybe even joke about your problems if he has a good sense of humor. \n\nNothing you listed so far is an unsolvable issue, but you have to have some uncomfortable conversations if you want to move forward. \n\nGood luck!": {

First, before I start to panic about something, I try to talk to my fianc\u00e9 about how I\u2019m feeling and what I\u2019m thinking about. \n\nAlso, remember that usually the negative thoughts you have are not your own. It\u2019s not unusual for abusive families to pretty much brainwash you into thinking the way they want you to think, because that\u2019s how they gain power and control over you. For me, I have to tell myself that these thoughts are not my own- they are the thoughts created by my past situation and they\u2019re more like the thoughts of those people that wanted control over me. So I try to let those thoughts go. \n\nI also try to let go of these thoughts because  I\u2019m scared of being abandoned. If my fianc\u00e9 was going to abandon me, then he wouldn\u2019t have proposed to me or probably stay with me for this long. I\u2019ve told him about my past and I also try to keep a VERY open line of communication. I tell him about things that happen to me, the good, bad, funny, etc. when I don\u2019t feel good, I tell him. I talk to him about these things because I also know him and trust him enough to know that his way of thinking is a lot more logical and rational than my own and he knows how to talk me through things and keep me calm. \n\nIt\u2019s for sure not easy coming out of survival mode like that. I 100% know that if he were to leave me I\u2019m in the same boat, no family, my friends are busy, so he\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.

Without it there, your liver just constantly leaks out bile instead of storing it.\n\nThose without gallbladders digest food a bit less efficiently than those with gallbladders.

Implosion is more efficient (roughly 1kg from the 6.4 of plutonium) but trickier to produce: you have to get the explosives to fire just right for it to produce a nuclear explosion.": {

    "Fat Man was simply a much more efficient design.\n\nA material undergoes fission more completely when its denser, and the implosion-type Fat Man physically compressed the plutonium to a significant degree.\n\nThe Little Boy design was on the ragged edge of fizzling because a gun-type design wants to blow itself apart before the fissile masses have reacted much. No such problem for an implosion weapon.\n\nLittle Boy was built and used first in combat without testing because of doubts that many had about the practicality of an implosion design (a lot of the initial implosion tests of inert cores didn't go very well).": {

This is one of the limiting factors for atomic bombs (fission bombs) - even if you add a heap more fissile material you don\u2019t get much more BOOM because it all gets dispersed in the first moment of the BOOM.\n\nThis is a big part of why nuclear (fusion and multi-stage) bombs can churn out so much more power - the setup allows/forces a much larger mass to take part in reactions before the materials all get dispersed.\u00a0": {

    "Not a financial expert but here\u2019s the layman\u2019s explanation as I understand it:\n1. Interest is the \u201cprice\u201d you pay to borrow money. Nobody is going to loan you money for free.\n2. That $400,000 is a lot of money, but it\u2019s discounted since much of it is future money which is worth less due to inflation. In 30 years, inflation could increase the price of eggs to $50 and minimum wage is $1million a year, but the numbers on your mortgage won\u2019t change.\n3. That 7% is yearly so you pay 7% of the remaining value of the loan (the principal) in interest every year. For a long term loan like a 30yr mortgage this really adds up. This isn\u2019t the correct calculation, but 7%*30=210% in interest. (The actual amount is a bit lower since you decrease the principal over time, which also decreases the dollar amount of interest every year).\n4. The lender could choose to not loan you the money and instead invest it in something like a govt bond that pays 5% for example. By lending to you at 7% they are trying to do 2% better than the \u201crisk-free\u201d rate and make more money overall. This is why mortgage rates are closely tied to the federal reserve (i.e. govt) interest rates. When the fed interest rates were really low a few years ago because of COVID this also made mortgage rates unusually low. Now that they raised the rates to fight inflation mortgage rates have come back up.\n5. Lending money to regular people comes with some risk that they will default and not be able to pay the loan back. This costs the lender money , so to offset it they may try to charge higher interest rates.\n6. Mortgages are a market and interest rates are determined by what people are willing to pay, i.e. supply and demand.\n6. Mortgage repayment is structured so each month you pay the same amount, regardless of how far you\u2019re into the repayment. This is called amortization. Your example $200,000 7% 30yr has a monthly payment of $1330. In the first month, you would owe $1166 of interest (200000*.07/12). The remaining $164 goes towards lowering the principal. The loan is only paid off when the principal hits $0, so when you start a loan most of your payment goes to interest and the principal is only chipped away at very slowly.\n7. You can reduce how much interest you pay by 1) choosing a shorter term mortgage, but this increases your monthly bill which not everyone can afford, 2) getting a smaller mortgage/putting more down payment, again not everyone can afford this, or 3) getting a lower interest rate, but this depends on your credit score and market conditions, among other things.": {

You pay back the loan gradually over a period of 30 years, so you're borrowing at least a little bit of the money for 30 years. \n\nGet your calculator and multiply 1.07 by itself 30 times, you'll see that 7% interest turns into 7.6 times the original balance (including principal) over 30 years. So some of the money gets paid back in a year or two, and some of the money becomes 7.6 times what you borrowed, and all the rest is somewhere in between. \n\nSo basically it's just that exponential growth is faster than you think": {

While much of the \"stuff\" will be picked up again and transferred to the venules (the tiny veins that pick up blood after it goes through the capillaries) a lot of fluid and stuff ends up elsewhere. That's why the body also has the lymphatic system, which has two functions. First it at as a sort of storm drain for excess fluid and cellular debris, carrying fluid back towards the heart for recirculation (about 15% of the fluid pumped out through your arteries goes back to the heart through the lymphatic system rather than your veins), with lymph nodes along the way that sort of functions like sewage plants. It also acts like a highway for white blood cells (ie, helps your immune system get where it's supposed to go) and functions as a sampling station for the adaptive immune system.": {

    "Yes, it does! Well it\u2019s not so much one big loop as a loop with many many branches along the way. The pressure is not the same everywhere because the number and structure of the vessels is different at different parts of the circulatory system. You can think of all of the blood going from the heart, out the aorta (the main artery), then through many branching arteries that branch and branch until they become a zillion capillaries, which then coalesce into many veins which all come back together at the vena cava (the main vein) that goes back into the heart.

The aorta has an arch with three offshoot arteries that go towards your arms and head. The rest goes down your ascending aorta which continues to branch off into smaller and smaller arteries. \n\nThe blood continues until it reaches a capillary. This is where the oxygen in the blood perfumes the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then heads back to the heart through veins. It\u2019s basically the same process as traveling through the arteries but in reverse. All the little tiny capillaries are connected to little tiny veins. As the blood travels back towards the heart, the tiny veins merge together into larger and larger veins until all the returning blood ends up in the superior or inferior vena cava, both of which lead back to the heart to start the cycle again.": {

Plus, the bigger return pipes (ie, veins) have valves in them to stop backflow. If you have visible veins in your arms you can see this by pressing down on one and sliding along one way, and doing the same the other way, and see which way squeezes blood out and which way it refills behind your sliding finger.\n\n\nOne important thing I want to add is that mammals have two big loops: one powered by the left side of your heart from there to the body and back, and one (at lower pressure) powered by the right side of your heart from there to the lungs and back. This means that your lungs can be more delicate, and hence better at doing the gas exchange they need, than if they had to operate at body blood pressure.": {

When the betting opens, Chad has odds of 50 to 1. The bettors place a crazy high amount of bets on Chad because they think the payout is worth the risk of him losing. In order to avoid having to payout a large amount of money should Chad win, the bookmaker adjusts the odds down to 20 to 1.

Even in the best case scenario where the seller absorbs *some* of the cost (because, for example, 100 sales at $50 profit are better than 10 sales at $100 profit), there's still some extra cost in there that wasn't there before.\n\nAll that you've accomplished is to basically put another hidden tax on goods.": {

    "A tariff is NOT a tax one country can level against another country. Such taxes *do not exist.* No sovereign nation would tolerate such an assault, because it would be blatant theft.\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. This means, any time anyone buys goods from some other country and imports them into the US, the *buyer* pays any tariffs on those goods. But the only people who can *import* things into the US...are people in the US. As a result, tariffs necessarily raise the price of goods that come from those imports, because they're taxed while local goods aren't. This means that tariffs make the overall economy less efficient than it could possibly be, but they can still have overall positive effects if used carefully.\n\nTariffs serve two main functions. The first is to protect domestic production against foreign manipulation. Let's say the Allied Federation of Fedoria and Yugopotamia are two countries, and Yugopotamia wants to capture a bunch of the AFF market for cars. So Yugopotamia gives a bunch of government subsidies to its domestic manufacturing, making it dirt-cheap to build cars. This is economically inefficient in the short term, but it can allow Yugopotamia to drive AFF auto makers out of business, thus giving Yugopotamia the dominant market share. To combat this trade manipulation, the AFF can impose a tariff on Yugopotamian cars. This will eliminate the price manipulation, and allow domestic manufacturing (which is cheaper long-term and has other benefits if it remains healthy) to remain competitive.\n\nThe second use of tariffs is as a tool of diplomatic or political leverage. If country A makes a LOT of money selling (say) crude oil to country B, but country B is much more influential and powerful, then B could pressure A to change policies or alter its goals by threatening or implementing tariffs on crude oil from A. This is a softer form of \"sanctions\" than outright blocking trade, but can still be effective. Of course, if two similarly powerful nations go head to head, you get a trade war, which is not generally good for either side, but that's a different subject.\n\nBut again, I want to stress: tariffs are NEVER paid by the country where the goods came from. They are, 100% always, paid by the people *buying* the goods for import, meaning, citizens of the country imposing the tariff. Tariffs almost always result in higher prices, because the person/company paying the tax has to make that money back somewhere else. Net result, tariffs are a sales tax on imported goods, which becomes a functional sales tax on the things regular folks actually buy.": {

    "Psychological tolerance happens when you have altered your *perceptions* (not your physical body or biochemistry), changing what you *feel* to be \"normal,\" so that normalcy to you now expects the drug, experience, etc. This may be bad, but is not *always* so, e.g. you can develop a tolerance to exercise so that it no longer feels like effort, but instead feels normal; this is generally a healthy thing in moderation.\n\nTolerance builds by slowly replacing your sense of what is normal, typical, expected. So if you drink coffee every morning for 10 years because you want to wake up quickly, you might become used to the effects of coffee, not because it no longer has physiological effect, but because you no longer remember the feeling of waking up on your own. So, if you then run out of coffee for two weeks, suddenly waking up feels *horrible*...not necessarily because of any physical addiction or tolerance (though that can happen with caffeine), but because now, waking up unaltered feels wrong and bad.\n\nPsychological tolerance develops more slowly than physiological tolerance. The two have no direct relation: you can have either one, both, or neither.

For example, the first time I moved to a very big city (I grew up in a smaller city, but still a city), I became acquainted with the awful, *awful* smell of summertime garbage day for the particular area I lived in. The stench was *really* obvious to me, as someone who hadn't grown up there.

    "Won\u2019t get into why in this comment (feel free to ask though) but the basic rules of a bicycle/motorcycle are as follows.\n\n1. If you begin a turn the handlebars to the left, this causes you to lean right.\n\n2. As the bike leans left, the handlebars want to turn left.\n\nBoth rules apply with left and right switched too.\n\nThese are important in bike design. They are the two fundamental rules that keep bikes stable and upright. Say you start accidentally leaning left, even without your hands at the handlebars rule 2 says the bike starts to turn left and because of that rule 1 says the bike starts to lean to the right, bringing you back upright. \n\nA deathwobble happens when these factors however overcorrect.\n\nIn nearly all cases the wobble starts with the front wheel being lifted off the ground and placed back down, be it from a wheelie or just a bump. But it\u2019s not placed back straight, it\u2019s placed to a side, say to the left. From there we get the following.\n\n\n1. Handlebars angle left. Due to rule 1, the bike starts leaning to the right, and quickly too, since you didn\u2019t slowly turn into this your wheel landed that way.\n\n2. The lean causes rule 2 to kick in, bike handlebars turn right. \n\n3. Bike starts leaning more to the left because of rule 1. Now we want a little bit of this because it will bring the bike back upright, but due to the speed at which this is all occurring at the bike overshoots due to the momentum of the turning wheel and starts leaning right.\n\nThen this all repeats, on the other side.\n\nThe bike is tuned to have rules 1 and 2 apply in the proper way when the wheels naturally turn and lean such that it can bring the bike upright and stable. However the landing of the wheel wrong causes it to overcorrect, this system is designed to handle gradual turns not a sudden left swerve due to the wheel landing wrong. This, and the tuning of these two factors depends on a variable, your center of mass, which is different for every rider and even different body position on the bike, which also causes over correction.\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t fight the wobble. Half the wobble is trying to save you here, the other half is trying to kill you, fighting it may cause you to fight the part that\u2019s trying to save you.

    "1. Better balance. Cheaper drivers tend to have too much or too little of bass/mids/treble. Studio monitors aim to be as flat as possible, representing all frequencies as \u201cequally\u201d as possible, while hi-fi will try to have a pleasant listening experience where bass/mids/treble may be more pronounced but not at the expense of muddying or burying the other frequencies (not boomy/boxy/shrill). The worst of the low end simply can\u2019t even reproduce certain frequencies full stop - they\u2019re just not as capable. These are the ones that sound like old radios and announcement systems. They simply can\u2019t recreate the bass and treble frequencies. In sound effects, we mimic these crappy sounding speakers by simply lowering the bass and treble in the EQ controls, which is what those low end speakers essentially do.\n\n2. Better clarity. Better drivers will respond faster and better, and have less distortion. The first one is important because you want a sound to start and stop immediately if they start and stop immediately, not fade in and fade out. If sounds ever so slightly fade in and out, the sound overall becomes muffled and muddles, like how loudspeaker announcements aren\u2019t as easy to understand when you have tons of echo going on. Having poor response can even lead to the creation of sounds that aren\u2019t on the record as the aound waves being created by the driver interact with each other. The second is the driver\u2019s ability to produce sound without breaking up. The simplest example of this is the way you could actually play a vinyl record with a needle and paper. You will hear what\u2019s on it, but it sounds so distorted, because the paper is not able to produce the right frequencies, so it just mostly farts. Good drivers are able to actually reproduce what\u2019s on the recording.\n\n3. Better build quality. Not all high end equipment sadly will have better build quality, as sometimes \u201chigh end\u201d simply means fancy, not higher quality. But for truly audio products (not just fashion tech), higher prices often mean better build quality. Cables are thicker and more robust, connectors have thicker and more durable plating, and come in the right size. Enclosures are tuned to how the speakers sound and interact with the air and not just random rectangle cabinets. Materials are selected for their durability and sonic capabilities. Components that are shielded are better shielded, and especially for radio/wireless, less prone to unwanted interference.\n\nAll these will in general basically give the average listener an experience where the sound is very clear and very enjoyable. This is why most people who have never listened with a good sound system will comment \u201cwow I didn\u2019t know it had that voice/instrument\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that before, has it been there all this time?\u201d and especially for headphones and properly set-up stereo systems, \u201cwow it sounds so 3D/realistic, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m on stage/in the studio with the artists\u201d.

That means, for more than half of riders, it is advantageous to buy insurance, even though the vast majority of them won't have a problem in any given year.\n\nAssume there are 1000 motorcycle riders who buy insurance. The insurance company thus pays out 100x$1200 = $120,000 each year to claimants who get injured (because 10% of 1000 is 100). But the insurance company *collects* $144x1000 = $144,000 each year. As a result, even after paying out the insurance claims to the yearly claimants, the insurance company still makes $24,000 profit each year.\n\nIn actual stuff, insurance companies do things like checking your history (medical history, driving history, etc.), estimating the risks, etc., etc., in order to give you a rate that is profitable for them--usually *very* profitable in the long run.": {

This would be a disaster for you, because rebuilding it or buying a new home costs a lot of money. It would take you decades to save enough.\n\nTo protect yourself against this risk you buy insurance.\n\nYou pay a monthly or annual \"premium\" to an insurance company. Lots of other people do the same. If your house does burn down the insurer will pay the cost of rebuilding it (provided you meet their policy terms & conditions).\n\nNow whether or not *your* house will have a fire in a given year is impossible to predict. But because of \"the law of large numbers\" a company that insures 100,000 houses can estimate fairly accurately how many fires there will be and how much they will have to pay out. Insurers are required to have \"reserves\" to make sure they can pay out, even if things turn out rather worse than they expected (they can also buy \"reinsurance\" to help with this).\n\nHow does the insurance company make money? Two main ways. First, by charging more in premiums than their costs. Second, by investing money.\n\nNow you might ask \"why should I buy insurance if (on average) companies pay out less than they take in?\" Well go back to how long it would take to save up to rebuild a house. *If* you're ok paying \u00a350k to rebuild your house or \u00a3500 to replace your smartphone, then you probably don't need insurance.": {

You *could* try to save up money for it, but that's a lot of money sitting around doing nothing. A better thing to do with your money is to invest it in stocks, or loan it out and collect interest. There are two problems with that: if you need money, you won't have it because you'll have to liquidate your investments; and, investing is way more effective if you have a lot of money to invest.\n\nInsurance companies collect a little bit of money from a *lot* of people, so they have a *lot* of money. They can then invest a lot of that money and collect interest, while still having enough to cover the relatively few individuals who need a payout.\n\nIt's also a way of *socializing* cost associated with risk. That is, rather than expect individuals to save and collect the large amount of money needed for emergencies, we can spread that cost out among a large group of people to make the cost relatively small for each person. The money from the healthy people with functional cars and a not burned down house are paying for the people who need help.\n\nThe insurance companies do a lot of math to figure out what they should charge. They consider how much on average it costs to pay out and the likelihood of paying out or how often, historically, they pay out, how many customers they can expect to get, and what customers seem willing to pay.

    "Some of the answer depends on if you're talking about cell phones or landline phones. \n\nIn both cases, no. Landline phones have no concept of a number for reasons that will be explained. Neither do cell phones, though how they get a number assigned is different.\n\nFor landline phones, historically your number literally indicated which wire in a switchboard was connected to your house. It worked like this:\n\n* Someone who wanted to make a call would turn a crank to \"call\" the operator, a person at the switchboard.\n* This would make a light next to their connector turn on. The operator would plug their phone into that line and ask who they wanted to call.\n* Then the operator would plug a wire from that connector to the connector for the number they wanted.\n* This would make the receiving person's phone ring. \n\nNow digital equipment tends to do that job, but it's still generally true that there is a wire from your house to some equipment somewhere. So ANY landline phone that plugs into your phone jack \"has\" the number, but in reality what's happening is the wires in the house \"have\" the number.\n\n(There are no-wire ways this can work but it's effectively the same as...)\n\nCell phones don't have wires. Getting a number is the job of the SIM card. Technically it doesn't have a phone number, it has a more complicated ID. When you buy a plan, the cell company is basically configuring their network to understand if someone calls a certain number, the network needs to send that call to the phone with your SIM. So in theory if you move your SIM to another phone, now that phone uses your number. (Some complications may require you to contact your carrier to make that happen.) \n\nSo it's kind of like how the internet works. When someone calls a phone number, that call goes to something that has to figure out how to connect the call. It has to ask, \"Where does this number go?\" If it goes to a landline network, some equipment somewhere understands how to connect a circuit to the wires in the house with the number. If it goes to a cellular network, some equipment somewhere looks to see if a SIM card is associated with that number and if any cell tower it knows of can reach that SIM card. \n\nThere are some exceptions! Cell phones (at least in the US) can make emergency 911 calls even if there is no SIM card. Technically you have no phone number when this happens, but technically the cell network doesn't *need* your phone number to PLACE a call. This is only mandated for 911, if you try to place other calls they are likely to fail. In theory, I'm sure a carrier like Verizon can place a call to a phone with no number by directly telling equipment to connect a call to a SIM, but in reality mere mortals are not going to be able to call a cell phone if it has no assigned number.

    "First of all Japan doesn't have a currency that works like dollars and cents. The Yen works like cents and has no equivalent of a dollar, so automatically you can take two zeros off the price of everything.\n\nAnother problem is that the interest rates in Japan are the lowest in the developed world. Japan actually had negative interest rates for while.\n\nEconomically Japan is a really weird country by our standards. People save a lot of money, culturally they are strongly opposed to price increases on anything (making it very hard for companies to raise prices and salaries) and it's really hard to get them to spend and invest.\n\nThe very low interest rates were an attempt to get people and companies to borrow money, any money, and trying to cause inflation in Japan.\n\nWomen in Japan (who traditionally are in charge of the family finances) started taking advantage to borrow money at almost no interest and invest it in foreign currencies waiting for the Yen to devalue, then would sell it to make money. This was referred to by the media as 'Mrs Watanabe'. With interest rates climbing you can't do this anymore and many women were caught out, stuck with loans they had to rapidly pay off.\n\nJapan is in the midst of a population crisis with an aging population. Wages are stagnant, and they are having shortages of employees in the job market.\n\nThey also aren't allowing in a lot of immigrants to stem the tide like in North America.\n\nSo they are in an economic slump.\n\nJapan is also in the midst of a political crisis. They are effectively a 1-party system as the Democratically elected LDP has ruled over Japan almost continuously for nearly a century. They recently dropped to a minority government over some scandals so it's going to be that much harder for the already notoriously conservative Japanese government to pass laws and change policy.\n\nThe good news is tourism is booming. After a slump during the pandemic Japan is open to tourists again and the weak Yen means tourist dollars go further.\n\nBut the public is pushing back against this too calling it 'over tourism' as Western tourists are constantly shown on the news disrupting the lives Japanese and making an ass of themselves. A number of famous Youtubers made trips to Japan in the past year and did a bunch of stupid stunts for views and it made the situation a lot worse.\n\nOnly a small percentage of tourists are the problem, but the notoriously conservative and xenophobic Japanese love taking a hammer to the problem and have started banning foreigners from visit parts of the country.": {

In ELI5 terms, this gives them an idea of how much \"extra income\" you have to make additional loan payments. Usually a bank will take your income and allow something like 40-50% of it as a maximum loan payment. So in your case 50% of your income is 75,000. Then it will deduct from that 75,000 all current loan payments. For example if you have car loan payments of 15,000 a year, then the difference (75,000-15,000) is 60,000. It will not give you a loan that has payments greater than 60,000 a year. This gets complicated as the \"income\" should consider your tax liability too. Whether or not you should take that sum is for you to consider as the banks want to lend you as much as they can but your lifestyle might not allow you to borrow that much money.\n\nIt will also consider your home equity IF you are willing to pledge it as collateral for any new loans.

Two liquids in contact with each other will transfer energy relatively well, but won't transfer it to gas hardly at all.\n\nYou can see this in action with things like percussion and string instruments.

However, despite the typically lower interest rates compared to other loans (auto, personal, business, etc. ), you pay back WAY more than \u2018a little extra\u2019 relative to the purchase price of the home. This is because mortgages are typically structured over a long time period (e.g., 15, 20, or 30 years) with interest taking priority over principal\u2014so that monthly payments in the early years of a mortgage mostly go towards the interest (you payoff the lender, i.e., bank, first & gradually more and more of the monthly payments apply to the principal).

    "Short answer:\nThe \"goal\" of cancerous cells/tumors is to keep growing as much as it can. There is only so much blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc in the area immediately surrounding the tumor. If it stayed in the same place it would eventually reach a growth limit. So if it wants to keep growing, it eventually finds a way to break through the membranes of whenever it is and travel through the bloodstream to grow somewhere else\n\n\n\nLong answer:\n\nCells have DNA. Some parts of the DNA are responsible for telling cells how often they should divide.\n\nWhen DNA is damaged, it's called a mutation. Mutations can be caused by toxins (eg. tobacco, alcohol), the environment (eg. sun exposure, radiation) or cell division (cells can mess up while dividing).\n\nIf a mutation occurs in the part of the DNA that's responsible for telling the cell how often it should divide, you get cancer- cells that will divide inappropriately or in an uncontrolled way.\n\nHowever, remember how one of the ways mutations occur is during cell division? Well if a cancerous cell is dividing uncontrollably, it increases the chance that mutations occur. These mutations can occur anywhere in the DNA which means all sorts of normal cell functions are at risk.\n\nCancer cells eventually get the ability to produce their own blood supply, suppress local immune function, ignore normal nutrition needs, etc. Another very common mutation they acquire is metastasis. That is, the mutate to the point that they ignore the blueprint for normal tissue structure. They break free from the organized cells around them, breakdown surrounding connective tissue and eventually end up in the blood stream where they are carried somewhere else in the body.\n\nWhere they implant and grow next often has to do with what sort of cell the cancer started out as. Different cells are more \"compatible\" with certain organs.\n\nSOURCE: whatever I remembered from my 500 level biology of cancer class lol": {

    "When you poll voters, you ask a few hundred people who they're voting for and try to extrapolate how *millions* of people will vote from that. This is a messy process\u2014while a random sample of people should theoretically be representative of a larger whole, lots of factors (like what kind of people are likely to pick up the phone and talk to a pollster, or the fact that not everyone votes) mean that if you just take the raw poll result at face value, there's a good chance you'll be way off.  \n  \nSo pollsters weight their polls\u2014they look at the random sample of people they got and change how much weight different types of peoples' answers have to match what they think the real electorate will actually look like. For example, if you poll 500 people and only reach 200 Republicans, but in past years Republicans have made up 43-47% of the electorate in a given state, you might assign more weight to the answers you got from Republicans so your sample matches that. This involves some level of educated guesswork, because no two elections see the exact same people turn out.  \n  \nHerding is when pollsters look at the other polls being released and either don't release polls of their own that look like outliers, or they change how they're weighting the poll to change the composition of the electorate so that their result is closer to what other people are saying. It's not really a defensible thing to do statistically (good polling *should* produce outliers sometimes because it's an expected artifact of having a low sample size compared to the total group), but you can sort of see why someone might do it\u2014if everyone is saying \"this election is 50/50\" and you get a poll result that says one candidate is actually up by 7, it takes a lot of guts to release that result and stand out from the crowd.  \n  \nEspecially when polls have often missed in recent years\u2014famously underestimating Trump in 2016 and 2020, and underestimating Democrats in 2022\u2014it can be easy for pollsters to second-guess themselves. We've seen a lot of pretty clear herding this year (we can tell because, as mentioned above, there *should* be a lot more noise and outliers, and normally are) because of pollsters being unwilling to stand out from the crowd, and it makes it difficult to tell if the election is *really* about 50/50 or if there's a feedback loop where people are less wiling to release polls that deviate from what \"looks right\".": {

    "Herding is a phenomenon in political polling, where a pollster will massage/alter their results to fit in with (a) what other pollsters are showing, and/or (b) what the pollster believes the 'real' position to be.\n\nFor example, the US Presidential election polling has all been very close, almost all 1-2% either way. Suppose a pollster obtained a result saying 'Trump + 8' or 'Harris + 8'. \n\nGiven all the other polls are very close, the pollster might say \"Well, this is completely out of step with all the other polls. I guess what's happened is that we've accidentally over-polled certain demographics that favour one side over the other, or the ones we DID poll are not representative for some reason. But if I assign this demographic a lower weighting in my calculations, I now get a Tie. That fits in with what everyone else is saying, so that must be the correct way to handle this\".\n\nThis is 'herding' in its purest form. Note that it is not necessarily a BAD thing....it could legitimately be that the pollster obtained an unrepresentative sample by chance, and that gave them a freak result. Massaging the weighting of demographics was the 'right' thing to do to get an accurate result. \n\nWhere herding becomes interesting is where the election result really does turn out to be a Trump or Harris + 8. Then you sometimes get pollsters after the fact admitting \"Actually we DID get Trump + 8 in our last poll, but we didn't think it was correct so we didn't report it like that\". \n\nThese scenarios raise questions about how true or accurate polling really is, and/or can also raise conspiracy-type arguments about 'pollsters putting their fingers on the scale to push Their Side'": {

    },
    "You know how when something is on fire, it releases energy in the form of light and heat? Your body is doing largely the same thing, but much slower.\n\nIn some materials, breaking the bonds between atoms releases energy. The equation goes both ways. For example:\n\nSugar + oxygen <=> carbon dioxide + water + energy\n\n(Edit: the previous version of this post had \u201cenergy\u201d on both sides, which was a mistake! Thanks to commenters for pointing that out)\n\nWhen plants do photosynthesis, they take in water, CO2, and energy from sunlight. They use that energy to rearrange the CO2 and water molecules into sugar and O2. Then they store the sugar, or do more chemistry to it to make other things in their bodies.\n\nThe opposite process is respiration. Plants do this themselves, rearranging that stored sugar, plus some O2, into CO2 and water. This releases energy that the plant can use to do things like grow or make seeds. If we eat the plant instead, we can also do respiration, taking the plant\u2019s sugar, combining it with O2, and getting energy, CO2, and water. If the plant instead burns, like wood in a fireplace, the same reaction happens\u2014just all at once.\n\nThis can happen with sugar, or with other materials like proteins and fats. We and other living things can also convert different materials into each other. When we eat food, some of that we can combine with oxygen and use for energy; some if it we can\u2019t but the microbes in our intestines can; some of it we can\u2019t and passes through is; and small amounts of it are other substances we absorb not to use for fuel, but to incorporate into our bodies.": {

Acid breaks things down into smaller molecules, untangles proteins, and turns on a stomach enzyme called pepsin. Pepsin starts chewing up proteins into individual building blocks called amino acids. \n\n3. Un-acidify that stomach acid-food mix, called chyle, on its way into the small intestine.\n\n4. Squirt enzymes from the pancreas into the small intestine. This is where the bulk of the work gets done: enzymes called amylases, proteases, and lipases go to town breaking everything up into tiny bits.\n\n5. Squirt bile from the gallbladder into the mix. Fats and water don't mix, and you're mostly water. Bile makes it so you can digest your fats. \n\n6. The fats get absorbed directly into your lymphatic system.\n\n7. The proteins and carbs get picked up by amino acid and glucose transporters.\n\n8. The rest, mostly stuff you can't digest passes along into the large intestine. You suck out the water from it. Bacteria break bits down and you absorb those bits. This is where farts are made. \n\n9. Poop\n\nThe fats mostly go to fat cells for storage. The amino acids and glucoses go mostly to your liver first. Glucoses get turned into glycogen for storage. Amino acids don't have a storage mode so they get turned into protein, shipped out, or used straight away. \n\nWhen you need some energy, glycolysis (for carbs), proteolysis (for proteins) or lipolysis (for fats) breaks the stored versions down all the way into a chemical called Acetyl CoA\n\nThat goes into something horrible called the Krebs cycle. A teacher will one day make you memorise it. You will forget it. By not telling you what it is, we can skip a step and you can forget about it in advance. \n\nWhat's important is a few chemicals get made: ATP, FADH and NADH. ATP is your cells energy cash that it spends to do things like make enzymes do stuff or operate pumps. Having *some* is good, but we need a ton.\n\nEnter oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nNADH and FADH carry electrons into something creatively called the electron transport chain. It happens in the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. \n\nIn short, their electrons get shuttled along to power tiny machines that pump hydrogen ions out of the mitochondria. The last step is a tiny turbine that is powered by letting the hydrogen ions flow back inside through it, only instead of making electricity, it makes more ATP; cell energy. \n\nATP stands for Adenosine Tri-Phosphate.

That means it cuts through mostly capillaries, where the blood is being squeezed through tiny spaces. All of those sliced capillaries start gushing blood, but there's not a whole lot *in* them--and then the exposure to the air almost immediately begins the coagulation process, putting thin patches over the holes. As the blood dries, it becomes a better and better layer of protection.\n\nThe pain, likewise, comes from the extremely high density of nerve endings in the hands, where most paper cuts occur. Your hands, feet, face, and genitals have *by far* the highest density of nerve endings of any part of your body--to the point that the \"sensory homunculus\", a little figure where the scale of body parts is based on how many nerve endings are present there, has *absolutely hilariously* oversized hands and feet, while its arms, legs, and torso are barely even present.

This disgestion usually takes alot of time, thus the energy wouldn't be available for a while, and would only be introduced to the bloodstream slowly.

    "Let's think about it first in terms of a multiplayer game. In many multiplayer games there are two major aspects at play: Some chance based mechanism (card deal, dice roll, stuff like that) and the other player's choices.\n\nGame Theory is all about understanding and responding to the player choice aspect of the game.\n\nLet's take Poker, for poker there are pre-determined odds for every possible hand, this is the chance based mechanism.\n\nHowever, players make choices on what to bet based on limited information: The cards they were dealt. In some types of Poker some public cards are revealed, players can then make calculated decisions on what hands are possible, then bet accordingly. Other players then have to take into account both the hand possibilities *and the bet of the other player* when making their own decision. Taking into account the other player's behavior is the game theory aspect.\n\nSo say you have a straight, and you know from the public appearing cards you have the second best possible hand, but there is a low statistical liklihood that the other player has the better hand. The other player bets first and places a *huge* wager. Now you have to weigh the low statistical liklihood that they have the better hand against their behavior. Are they bluffing to get you to fold and lose? You may have a better idea of this if you've studied their tendencies and play styles from previous games.\n\nNow obviously you can expand this to basically all human interactions where there is some winner and some loser. The best approach to take has to take into account the other person's agency and decision making while navigating the interaction. This is why it's also applicable to things like economics, politics, war, and so many other social sciences.": {

This assumption is vague: what do \"perfectly logical\" and \"most beneficial\" mean, even just in the context of the prisoner's dilemma? The basic mathematical formalism of game theory does not say anything about how players choose strategies. Some applications of game theory make assumptions along these lines, but others explicitly do not. For example, there are people who do experiments to try and understand how real people behave in games. And one of the most prominent applications of game theory, in evolutionary biology, treats the players as if they have no agency and always follow a simple procedure.": {

    "Since electronic votes are encrypted, the danger is that the voting device can, maliciously or otherwise, change the vote before encryption. However, checking the encrypted vote to ensure it matches breaks voter secrecy. Unfortunately there isn't a simple way around this.\n\nThe Benaloh Challenge describes a process in which how voters may gain confidence that their votes are cast as intended, while at the same time preserving the secrecy of the vote. It arises from a game-theoretic treatment of encrypted voting. There are two 'players' in this game: the voter and the encryption device. The voter obviously wants to make sure their vote is not altered, while the encryption device may be malicious and try to bias the cast vote, or it may be faulty and change the vote randomly.\n\nThe challenge is the process (simplified from [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03258) and [[2]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173750)):\n\n1. The voter fills in their ballot and passes it to the encryption device.\n2. The device encrypts the ballot. The device provides back to the voter some 'check-code' or a equivalent way which can be used to verify the encryption of the vote.\n3. The voter decides either to finalize and cast their ballot, in which case we finish, or verify (i.e. *challenge*) the encryption (step 4).\n4. If 'to verify' is chosen, the vote is, well, verified (in manner that is *trusted* by the voter) and the voter gets to see whether their choice and that of the encrypted ballot match. However, this spoils the vote and we go back to step 1 to repeat the process.\n\nThe voter can challenge the encryption as many times as desired, but once the ballot is cast, the process ends. Note here that this cast ballot is not verified by the voter (otherwise this would break secrecy), but the device does not know whether the voter will choose to cast the encrypted ballot or how many times the voter will choose to verify.\n\nIn game theory we want to examine how these two agents will act (assuming they only are concerned with their self interests) - how many times the voter will verify, how often a malicious encryption device may alter the vote, etc. There will be payoffs and costs defined for the voter and device which are used to determine each party's best course of action.

She picks her choices, and the machine turns her vote into a secret code so that no one can see who she voted for. But Alice wants to be sure the machine didn\u2019t secretly change her vote when it coded it.\n\nTo prove that it\u2019s being honest, the machine shows Alice a digital receipt (called a commitment) that represents her coded vote. This receipt doesn\u2019t show the actual vote, just proof that it exists in coded form. At this point, Alice has two choices: she can either trust the machine and submit her vote, or she can test the machine to make sure it wasn\u2019t lying. \n\nIf Alice chooses to test the machine (a challenge), the machine has to reveal the behind-the-scenes work it did\u2014like the original marked ballot and random numbers it used to create the code. The vote then becomes invalid and has to be recomputed as all the secret numbers have been revealed (Alice has to re-enter the vote and can decide if the she wants to test the machine again or submit after getting a new commitment). But alice can then use a trusted device like her phone to check if these match the receipt. If they do, it means the machine didn\u2019t change her vote and was honest. If not, the machine gets caught cheating. \n\nThe trick is that the machine never knows if Alice is going to submit her vote or challenge it until it\u2019s already made the receipt.

    "First, you should know (just in case) that STIs can be transmitted via other bodily fluids, most notably blood. This will be important later.\n\n\nSome STIs just have followed humans since before humans were humans. Herpes type 1 (\"oral herpes\", but can cause sores anywhere including the genitals) is one of them: every great ape species has their own herpes virus that followed them as the different species evolved, including us. Gonorrhea can only infect humans, and no animal species has a similar disease, so it was possibly picked up from random bacteria in the environment and it adapted to live in us.\n\n\nSome other STIs we acquired from other animals. This did not mean people got frisky with these animals: the vast majority of these diseases we acquired from eating the infected meat or getting inflected animal blood into scrapes and cuts.\n\n\nHerpes type 2 (\"genital herpes\" but can also cause cold sores) is a close relative of gorilla herpes, which scientists thought we acquired hundreds of thousands of years ago when an early human scavenged a gorilla carcass.\n\n\nHIV came from the early to mid 20th century from people cut themselves while cutting into a chimp carcass and getting infected chimp blood into the cuts. Their equivalent, SIV is a minor inconvenience to them, but it's lethal to us.\n\n\nChlamydia my have come from handling infected meat of any of the thousands of animal species that host one of the different species and strains of Chlamydia bacteria, including ruminants, poultry, cats, swine, etc. Most strains cause lung and eye infections, so the jump to an STI in humans is still a bit of a mystery.\n\n\nSyphilis has a similar story as Chlamydia: there are similar diseases floating around in other livestock animals like cows, although most are regular diseases and aren't STIs in these other species.": {

The hunter cuts themselves while slicing up the meat, or they got bitten while killing the monkey, or whatever...there's a fresh, open wound and the hunter gets blood from an infected monkey into his own wound, and the disease gets transferred that way.\n\nSome STIs are ancient. Herpes I is so old that humans have had it since before we were human. It evolved with us, and its origin is so old that no one knows for sure how it evolved. All we know is that our ancient ancestors already had it long before Homo sapiens existed. Herpes II is almost as old and came from close relatives. It may have come from sexual contact, but again this was before Homo sapiens existed as a species - it wasn't humans have sex with monkeys, it was our primate ancestors having sex with monkey primate ancestors.\n\nScabies also probably evolved with us and have been with us since before Homo sapiens existed. They evolved from body lice.\n\nAll of the STIs came from one of those two sources: it evolved with us as a species from some exposure long before humans existed; or, there was some other kind of exposure, probably blood contact from fighting or hunting.": {

Viruses (as the vast majority, if not all of these STIs) evolve to better infect other living beings, and may evolve different transmission paths.

There are four factors, including whether the unauthorized use is commercial and whether it has an effect on the market for the original. Check out the statute, it's 17 USC 107. You're invoking a version of the idea of \"transformativeness\" that is part (but not all) of the factor one analysis. Even then, that idea (which is itself a judicial gloss on the statute that may have been rolled back a bit by the recent Warhol decision) looks to transforming the purpose of the owner's work, and making one pop track into another pop track is pretty much the same purpose. If you're sampling, for example, a voice over from the news maybe you have a better argument.\n\nSecond, sampling entails making a direct reproduction of an owner's sound recording, not just the musical composition that underlies it. Because that is a verbatim copy, many courts have been unsympathetic because it is not a transformation but just a transposition of the work. If sampling entailed modifying the sound recording, this might come out differently. But then it wouldn't be sampling.\n\nFinal point, I don't like how copyright law interacts with the practice of sampling. My sense is that it makes it too risky and deters creativity.

    ">I feel like a lot of left-wingers are stuck in the mindset, that Non-Western cultures are inherently less oppressive and more free than Western cultures,\n\nAs a leftist myself, we're not stuck in this mindset because it is just obviously wrong. We recognize that many \"traditional cultures\" are just as reactionary and oppressive as western reactionaries are. It's just that we also recognize that criticism of non-western cultures that comes from a place of cultural superiority and imperialism isn't going to help. The only people who can reform a culture are the people actually from that culture who understand it and can make meaningful change. \n\nThere's a famous piece that anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod published shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan that summed up this position extremely well. She observes the focus in western media on the oppressed Afghani women as a justification for the invasion, but argues that westerners unfamiliar with Afghanistan didn't really understand what Afghani women wanted or needed. Moreover, nearly everything that westerners could do to intervene in Afghanistan would just end up making things worse, by making the lives of the few Afghani reformers  much harder, while causing significant backlash that just enabled and emboldened the conservatives. I think we can all agree that history has completely vindicated her: everything that the west did to \"save\" the women of Afghanistan has massively backfired and in the end just made it all worse. \n\nThis isn't to say that it isn't always the place of westerners to criticize things that are bad, no matter where we see them. But it is to say that a lot of that criticism is counter-productive. \n\nIncidentally this also applies to some extent to segments of our own culture.

Neglecting to do so would mean you're willingly purchasing something without a full understanding of how it works or what it even is. Legislation requires all companies who are involved in gambling to have this information available. If the information is available, they've fulfilled their obligations.

When testing the limit of what could be considered misleading, lawmakers take into account how \"any reasonable person\" would interpret the information. If this has 45 numbers, and the maximum prize is anywhere up to $45, it's reasonable to assume there's a 1 in 45 chance of winning up to $45.. If the prize is much greater than $45, it's reasonable to assume the odds aren't 1 in 45,  and that's just how the game is designed. In this case, it would be wise to do a couple of minutes research so you can understated how the game works before paying to enter. \n\nTo be blunt, you can't claim to have been defrauded when all the information was freely available to you, but you simply chose not to read it. \n\n>\"It would be the equivalent of me telling you to guess a coin flip, but written on the bottom of my foot is a \"rule\" that lets me flip the coin to the opposite of whatever you picked 499,999 times out of 500,000. Then blaming you for not checking the bottom of my foot.\n\n>This fraud has become so commonly accepted that people blame you for taking their game's advertised rules at face value.\"\n\nIn your scenario, personal responsibility plays a part. If you were offering me better odds than 2-1, I'd enquire abkut how it all worked. And then you would be legally obliged to show me your foot.\n\nEither way, that's not whats happening here, nothing is being changed to make you lose, that has long been decided \n\nJust because the results are predetermined, this doesn't mean it's rigged for you to lose. Well, any more than it already is, of course.\n\nThe chance of you physically picking out the winning number from a giant barrel with the same amount of entries the algorithm is working off is identical to you being the person who purchases the predetermined winning entry. There's 1 ball out of 500000 in the barrel, and there's 1 entry you can buy out of 500000 available that the algorithm has predetermined to be the winner.\n\nIt may feel more genuine or random or fair to pick the ball out of the barrel than it does to purchase an entry knowing the result is already decided, but the chances of being the winner are identical.\n\n  \n>-\"This is how the printable EzMatch and Scratch Off tickets work.\n\n> All the \"games\" and \"rules\" are obfuscation to hide the fact that the odds are astronomically higher than the known games they advertise (Bingo, 7-11-21, Lotteria, Number Matching, Monopoly, etc). \"\n\nI looked up this website and rhe odds are clearly displayed, ie [here](https://www.valottery.com/scratchers/2199) you can see it clearly states the odds are 1 in 4.02 for any (minimum) prize and 1 in 1,632,000 for the top prize of $100k - Horrible odds, to be fair. You're better of with sportsbetting and just putting together an outrageous parley. At least then a 1 in 100,000 chance would return $100k from a dollar.\n\n> \"The matching numbers they list are also irrelevant since they don't have ANY relevance to whether a ticket is a winning one or not. The numbers are just a fa\u00e7ade to fraudulently think that the odds of winning are significantly higher than they really are. \"\n\nYes, none of what is displayed means anything other than WIN or LOSS. Like with slot machines when players can try to double or quadruple thier win by choosing red black, hearts, spades, etc... people thinki they're actually guessing what the card will be, but in reality these are pre determined to be WIN or LOSS. So all you're guessing is whether or not this next play will win or lose.\n\n> \"BTW, the tickets are in the machine with only the front facing so you can't read the back. Also the back contains ZERO information about the real odds. Instead it has a single line of small text that says \"visit the website for the rules\". That is only available after you've bought the ticket. \"\n\nAgain, the machine would be covered in branding and there's nothing stopping you from taking a minute to look up what you're about to spend money on. No reason why anyone can't or should not do this.\n\n> \"Convince me that it isn't fraud to advertise \"games\" with \"rules\", but the games and rules advertised don't matter because theres a second hidden set of rules that make you lose way more.\"\n\nIt isn't fraud for the reasons I've explained above, and the fact that it's all entirely legal and transparent. There is nothing forcing you to make a purchase in order to gain access to the information you need, anyone can access it at any time.\n\nUnethical? Perhaps, given it's quite clear these games pray on the impulsive and would likely expect people to make uneducated purchases. But at what point does personal responsibility come into play? This is a gambling business, not a charity. They exist to make money from people. If you want to gamble, understand the game you're playing.\n\nPredatory? A lot of gambling is, especially in the US sports market where it's still the wild West and people are learning about bookies the hard way. But these kind of lotto games can't be deemed predatory simply because they exist.\n\nEnd of the day, it's on you to make an educated decision on what you're spending your money on. Gambling is for adults, so be an adult and approach it maturely. Gambling is tightly regulated, so you can be sure everything is above board, even if the obvious isn't slapping you in the face. People research consumer goods they want to buy, why would gambling be any different? \n\nMisleading odds should be illegal, and they are. The games you describe do not satisfy the criteria to be considered \"misleading\"\n\nTLDR - Struct regulations + common sense + personal responsibilit ensure  educated purchases + knowing what you're betting on": {

    "I'll take a stab at this:\n\n1. The odds should be self-apparent from the prize amount. If a ticket costs $1 and the prize is more than $45, the odds can't possibly be 1:45 because the lottery would lose money. For example, if the prize was $100 with 1:45 odds, they would have to give out $100 in prizes for every $45 in revenue. The math doesn't work. This reality is represented by the phrase, \"The house always wins.\" \n\n2. It is good that the lottery makes a profit. State-run lotteries support admirable causes such as education, public health, infrastructure, and natural conservation. See [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/12/1148167357/lottery-money-state-by-state-mega-millions-powerball). Typically, 40-60% of lottery winnings go to the state.\n\n3. Combining these two facts, if the odds were 1:45, and 50% goes to the state, the prize can be no more than $22.50. Put another way, if the state sells $45 of tickets, and must keep half, they only have $22.50 left to give to players. This is good because the profit benefits admirable causes (see #2).\n\n4. Seeing as it is a common saying that \"the house always wins,\" and casual math can determine if odds are plausible or not, the state should not have to further clarify the lottery odds. The imagination of your chance of winning is part of the fun experience. Telling you in bold face font that you have a 1 in 50,000 chance would make the game less fun, attract fewer players, and therefore generate less revenue. It is good that the state generates revenue from this. In conclusion, it should be legal for the lottery to present misleading odds.": {

It argues that any time you spend money on a non-essential good that you are committing an immoral act, because that money could've been donated to a humanitarian charity that could prevent \"suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care\". That action of spending money on something non-essential providing minimal happiness to yourself, compared to inaction of lack of donation which is akin to seeing a child in a lake and letting them drown, is immoral.\n\nI'd agree with this, but *objectively,* if we are to accept this argument, the immorality of inaction would be on a linear scale. A lower middle class person may buy a pastry once a week from their local bakery, summing $10. A billionaire may treat themselves by buying a $100 million yacht. Obviously, this is a vast oversimplification, but *objectively* the amount of good that can be done by a humanitarian charity is higher with more money than less money. Therefore, it is more immoral to make the yacht purchase than the pastry purchase, and in general more immoral to have more excess than less.\n\n>If I'm going to give myself a pass for keeping my wealth, then I can't very well chastise others for doing the same thing I am doing, now can I?\n\nSo the idea that something that you cannot criticize something *objectively far worse* by orders of magnitude (assuming you accept a Singer-like argument as a premise) than the action you're participating in to avoid hypocrisy is an absurd claim.": {

I disagree with this and I assume this is also what you disagree with.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever I've also met kids for whom homeschooling was the only realistic option. Namely, I went to college with some 14 year olds. They were taking graduate level physics classes and functionally at what would be 18th grade if college kept counting grades linearly like public schools.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Socialization\" is important - but socialization between a ten year old and a twenty year old is different than socialization between two ten year olds, but academically they would have been equivalent.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is solved by homeschooling. Having the parents teach the kids grades 1-16 on an accelerated schedule but having the kids socializing with kids their age.\u00a0\n\n\nPublic school is set up to handle the median. Each kid advances one grade per year. Public school doesn't always serve kids who are capable of doing 3 or 4 grades per year. Socialization in public school largely revolves around class time and it's hard to socialize in a public school setting when you are academically 9 years above other kids your age.\u00a0": {

    "Misconceptions about homeschooling ignore the substantial resources and flexibility it offers. Today\u2019s homeschooling families access diverse educational supports like online courses, certified curricula, tutors, and co-ops, enabling them to provide well-rounded, often academically superior education. Research indicates that homeschooled students often perform well on standardized tests and excel in college, challenging the notion of academic disadvantage.\n\nSocialization is similarly misunderstood. Homeschooling provides children with rich, varied interactions, from co-ops and extracurriculars to community activities, often fostering maturity and adaptability. Homeschoolers can avoid negative social pressures typical in schools, like bullying and conformity, while developing strong, independent identities. Moreover, as homeschooling grows, networks of homeschooled students create shared experiences, mitigating any feelings of being \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\nFamilies homeschool for diverse reasons, including personalized education and fostering critical thinking\u2014not to shelter children from ideas. The broad outcomes for homeschooled students are positive, with many colleges actively recruiting them for their independence and preparation. Studies show they become engaged, successful adults, making the assumption that homeschooling is \u201cdamaging\u201d unfounded.

Socialization can happen through extracurriculars, homeschool meetups, etc.\n\nThere are also other, possibly more common, reasons to homeschool. Maybe the child has severe anxiety about school, or social anxiety, and needs a different environment to be conductive to learning or to practice social skills in a safe environment. Maybe the child was bullied and transferring to another school isn\u2019t an option (I\u2019m from a city with a single high school, nearest school is over 1.5 hours away so clearly not an option).

    "First, certain songs are directed with a specific message to a specific audience. You were not the intended audience. Some artists love to make provocative music. That doesn't mean anything. There are lots of metal and punk bands that sing about violence, murder, suicide, and burning down churches, but the artists are usually living a rather normal life and don't go on killing sprees. It's part of the act to be provocative.\n\nSecond, the most talked about things are not the things that most people actually do. People like to talk about transgressions and things that are provocative, but that doesn't mean that they all do it. Same for the media: people love to watch crime movies, doesn't mean they want to do crime.\n\nThird, I presume that many women who put stuff like this on dating apps are rather looking to sell their pictures or lure guys to their OnlyFans. Again, this is a message directed at a specific audience that is not you.\n\nFourth, yeah, times have been changing. Lots of experimentation is going on in the bedrooms. However, you ignore the other aspects of this: consent. There has been a tremendous debate about consent and its importance, much more comprehensive than the debate you mention above. So it's you who notices only one aspect of a much broader cultural shift.\n\nWith the focus on consent, lots of behavior is also deemed unacceptable that was just normal 50 years ago - groping, catcalling, slapping women's behinds, pressuring women etc. Watch an older James Bond movie, for example, and see how Bond treats women. Such a behavior in the media would be a huge no-go these days. Nowadays, lots of movies, books etc. depict women in exactly the opposite way as you complain, namely as strong, assertive people with their own agency.

As long as all people involved are consenting adults, no actual harm is being done.\n\nBeyond that basic layer of \"who cares as long as the people doing it are enjoying it,\" I would say a lot of kinks fit similar patterns: being completely out of control or completely in control, wanting something forbidden, etc. At the end of the day, why something excites someone involves a lot of different overt and subtle psychological factors.

It doesn't change the fact you lost your right leg/took a devastating injury to your right leg and you likely would not want the same to happen to your remaining left leg.\n\nThe logical path your argument would need to take in this circumstance is that you would need to explain to women why their right being taken away somehow does not make them worse off, as in, there's either a net zero or even positive effect on their overall well being/lives.\n\nGood luck making that argument.": {

    "Firstly, there is immense privilege experienced by most people in modern america relative to many alternatives (temporal or geo-political).  So...a rising tides lifts all boats is true in my view.\n\nSecondy, the right to abortion is an important issue because _a lot of women don't have it anymore_.  Your framing seems kinda absurd to me - that it's a state issue now is true.  It's also true that people in many states don't have that right.  That's dystopian for those who live in those states.  Having guns is not totally a normal thing and shouldn't be, but it's a right.  25% of women have had an abortion and it's reasonably consistent between righ/left political lines (arguably because a lot of republicans currently are pro-choice to some degree or another).  \n\nSecondly, you're more likely to be a victim of sexual violence and domestic violence, but less so of a violent crime (although much of male-on-male violence is contextualized within engagement in groups/activities with known violence).  You're more likely to be sexually harassed at work, experience unwanted sexual contact of various sorts.  I certainly don't feel like my wife has it \"amazing\" when she gets felt up once a week on public transit going to work or has someone on a bus jerking off just because she might look.  Those are _totally normal experiences_, but seem far from amazing.  \n\nWomen also get left with children and no financial support from the father A LOT more than men lose custody, they carry more of the parental demand on average (lots of great movement in this area which makes this father very happy).  \n\n13% of women will end caring directly for an elderly parent, but 7% of men.  We lay the caretaking for family on women and men can take the \"not my problem\" approach they also seem able to take with children.  Of course there are lots of exceptions, but the differences here are real.  \n\nIt's a mixed bag, but I think that while women have taken on more opportunity in education and work they have not redistributed the rest of what makes life run well at the family level - men have not taken up that work and responsibility proportionally (but things have indeed changed).": {

    "**1. Why do women-only scholarships exist?** Today, there are more women than men in higher education - but that is a very recent phenomenon. For hundreds of years, women were prohibited from getting higher education. You may argue that we have sufficiently \"course corrected\", but in doing so you admit that women were being wronged up until very recently and deserved help in the first place.\n\n**2. Why do women-only domestic violence shelters exist?** Because gendered violence is incredibly common. Yes, men are sometimes the victims of domestic violence and such men deserve protection and help just as much as women, but the vast majority of domestic abusers are men. **The need for domestic violence shelters for women is large - how is that a privilege?**\n\n**3. \"As if abortions are a totally normal thing to have in one's lifetime anyway (at least it certainly shouldn't be).\"** Imagine if we had this same attitude about people who need medical care due to car accidents, or smoking, or sports injuries, or anything else. Most people don't get in car accidents and need surgery anyway. \"You don't need to drive a car / smoke / play sports - why should you have a right to medical care for an injury that was completely avoidable?\" Since overturning Roe vs Wade, many American women who wanted to get pregnant and have a child die because of pregnancy complications that were completely avoidable but the medical procedures were not performed because they involve abortion, which is now illegal in the state where those women live. You can see [stories like this on reddit all the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/1gjx5j1/vote_for_her/). It is not okay that some states are allowed to ban women from receiving medical care under certain circumstances.\n\n**4. This isn't the end of the story.** Some Republican politicians, Republican doners, right-wing pundits and pseudointellectuals, and other right-wingers have expressed skepticism of women's right to vote and have floated banning certain kinds of birth control and banning no-fault divorce. Women fought hard for generations to get these rights and - somehow - in the last decade it has become politically feasible to consider revoking those rights.

    "I was a DoorDash driver for a long time and I remember the training they give you at the beginning quite well. When you go to pick up an order, your job is to confirm that you have the bag with the correct order. The bags are sealed and often tamper proofed. Not only are drivers not responsible for making sure the restaurant got your order correct, they\u2019re explicitly disallowed from doing so. Having a driver rifle through your food wouldn\u2019t be sanitary. Drivers also do not have the ability to have the restaurant remake food. If it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s cold. The driver\u2018s responsibility begins the moment they pick up the food and ends the moment they drop the food off at the correct location. Drivers aren\u2019t waitstaff, they\u2019re contract delivery drivers, and if you have a problem with the food the restaurant provided, you have a problem with the restaurant. DoorDash and the other delivery apps recognize this too, which is why there is a button in the app you can press if you got the wrong food, the food was bad, or if you didn\u2019t get any food at all.\n\nAdditionally, at least if you\u2019re using doordash and your food always seems cold, it\u2019s because drivers are refusing to accept your order because you\u2019re not tipping enough. Tipping culture sucks, but DoorDash doesn\u2019t pay shit if the tips aren\u2019t good, and DoorDash drivers aren\u2019t a charity.\n\nFood delivery is the peak of first world luxury and is an entirely unnecessary service.

Ultimately though, it doesn\u2019t matter what your opinion is. DoorDash and the other food delivery service providers have a business model that exploits restaurants, exploits drivers, and costs extra to you the consumer, and the only reason they\u2019re able to make a profit is because they keep all of the disparate parts of their system disconnected and modular. Dashers don\u2019t care about the accuracy or quality of your order because they aren\u2019t paid to do that, and the reason they aren\u2019t paid to do that is because it\u2019s more profitable that way.

The rest of the country just knew him as the manufactured TV personality on the apprentice. Producers have come out and said it was 100% a made up person they portrayed and it was actually very hard to spin him in a positive light. But he was entertaining in spurts so they stuck with him \n\n(Btw I hated him after the 2nd season. I thought he was so full of shit. Nothing he said was consistent and I picked up on his misogyny and racism even though they tried to hide it. I couldn\u2019t believe people kept watching.

I have a feeling that most of the people who are like \"ew, vegan food, I refuse to eat it\" will gladly enjoy a bowl of tomato soup with crusty bread or a bag of fries or a rice & bean burrito with salsa verde without batting an eye as long as you don't mention that those fries are VEGAN fries. \n\nI think that that demographic of people associates \"vegan food\" with fake food, or at least food which is unfamiliar to them and a poor imitation of \"real food.\" They think of vegan food as \"wrong.\" Processed imitation meat, or tofu and lentils in the shape of a chicken leg that you're supposed to say \"wow it's just like real chicken\" about and pretend that you'd never miss real meat if you just ate this every day.

In order for a heterosexual match to occur, both a man and a woman must have liked each other. This means the number of heterosexual matches must be the same across between men and women\n3. In order for your number of likes to go up, you just have to get swiped on. No match necessary. This necessitates no such accord between the number of likes given to women vs. given to men.\n\n**Now let's do a word problem:**\n\nImagine a dating app has 100 people on it. 75 of them are men and 25 of them are women. On day 1, all of them swipe on 4 people, 2 left, and 2 right. At the end of day 1, how many likes will men have received and how many likes will women have received?

Loyalty gives us stability and a deeper sense of trust, which is valuable in a society where everything often feels temporary. For example, in relationships, loyalty isn\u2019t just about \u201cdon\u2019t cheat\u201d; it\u2019s about building real trust and sticking together through tough times. Even in jobs, loyalty\u2014when it\u2019s mutual\u2014can create a healthier work environment and foster teamwork, which benefits everyone.\n\nLoyalty also brings a sense of identity and belonging. Family loyalty isn\u2019t about tolerating toxic situations; it\u2019s about honoring shared history and staying connected in meaningful ways. The same goes for patriotism. Sure, people are more critical of their countries, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care\u2014it just means loyalty is expressed through constructive criticism rather than blind allegiance.\n\nAnd honestly, loyalty helps build trust in a world that\u2019s becoming more transactional. When people choose to stick with a brand or a political party, it\u2019s often because they believe in a bigger cause or want consistency, not because they\u2019re being \u201cpandered to.\u201d Loyalty allows us to invest in something beyond ourselves, like supporting ethical brands or giving back to communities. Without it, we risk living in a society that\u2019s all about individual gain, with fewer people willing to work toward a common good.\n\nSo yeah, loyalty might be less about \u201cblind loyalty\u201d these days, but the commitment, trust, and mutual support it fosters are still key.

A \"social pressure\" does not describe the pressure one experiences in a dynamic with a single other individual; it describes the sort of pressure one experiences relative to the sort of 'abstracted other' we build in our minds to represent \"the views of the society around us\" after a group grows too large to track the opinions of each individual on every topic.\n\nThat structure gives rise to a new set of questions about how one 'ought to' behave.

    "Your argument suggests that morality is entirely subjective\u2014a tool for advancing personal or group interests. But if we fully adopt this view, we run into serious issues that show morality to be more than a mere instrument of self-preservation or power.\n\nFirst, if morality is purely subjective, it makes it impossible to meaningfully criticize any values or actions, including those that are oppressive or destructive. If you judge oppressors solely to defend your own values, then they, in turn, could argue that their actions reflect their subjective values. Following this logic, any act\u2014no matter how cruel or unjust\u2014could be justified simply because someone believes in it. Without some moral foundation beyond individual preferences, we lose any consistent basis for distinguishing between right and wrong, or for calling any values \u201charmful\u201d or \u201clacking.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, while you mention that the universe doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about values, the lack of cosmic oversight doesn\u2019t mean that moral principles are inherently meaningless. There are moral frameworks that have developed across cultures and persist precisely because they provide structure for functioning societies. Take the concept of natural law, for example, which argues that certain moral truths are inherent in human nature, such as fairness, empathy, and respect for others. This perspective isn\u2019t about cosmic judgment but about recognizing moral principles that align with our shared humanity. People who use this framework don\u2019t see morality as subjective but as rooted in objective principles that promote human flourishing and social harmony.\n\nAnother example is Kantian ethics, which proposes that moral actions are those that respect the inherent dignity and autonomy of individuals. According to Kant, we should act in ways that we can rationally will to be universal laws\u2014rules we\u2019d want everyone to follow. This framework isn\u2019t about advancing personal power but about respecting others\u2019 autonomy and recognizing their intrinsic worth. For instance, even if someone could gain from treating another person as a mere tool, Kantian ethics would argue against it, not because it\u2019s subjectively harmful but because it\u2019s objectively wrong to disregard someone\u2019s humanity.\n\nA third example is utilitarianism, which argues that the moral value of an action lies in its consequences, specifically in whether it maximizes well-being or minimizes harm. Under this view, the objective of morality is not simply personal gain but the greater good. If harming others increases suffering, then it\u2019s morally wrong by utilitarian standards, regardless of who holds power. This principle has been a foundation for social reforms that aim to improve overall well-being, like movements for civil rights and healthcare, which are viewed as morally good because they aim to benefit society as a whole, not just those in power.\n\nIf we reduce morality to nothing more than a power struggle, then any form of moral progress\u2014such as the abolition of slavery, the fight for human rights, or the establishment of laws protecting individuals from exploitation\u2014becomes impossible to justify. In a purely subjective framework, these movements aren\u2019t moral victories but simply shifts in dominance. However, societies worldwide have recognized these changes as morally \u201cbetter,\u201d suggesting that morality involves more than just the preferences of those in power.\n\nFinally, while personal and cultural values do vary, this doesn\u2019t mean all moral perspectives are equally valid. Certain actions\u2014like torture, exploitation, or oppression\u2014can be condemned because they inherently harm others. Empathy, a shared capacity for suffering, and our fundamental need for social cohesion point to a common basis for moral values. Morality, in this sense, isn\u2019t about asserting power but about building a society where individuals can live and thrive in mutual respect. This shared moral foundation is what allows us to condemn injustices and pursue a vision of a fairer world.\n\nIn short, reducing morality to pure subjectivity and power leads to contradictions that undermine justice and social cohesion. Recognizing a common moral framework allows us to meaningfully distinguish right from wrong and work toward a society where human dignity and well-being are valued above the interests of those in power.": {

I feel like \"Oh I got a C\" \"Damn, I got a C-. Jane over there got an A\" is pretty damn common schoolyard conversation. At work you literally get performance reviews.

You can try to study more than them, but they'll always have an image edge on you. \n\nHow does that follow at all? Intelligence is not innate. It's learned. Some people have an easier time doing that learning in certain areas or modalities, but no-one comes out of the birthing suite knowing algebra or aramaic. You absolutely can study more. Even if they're a savant, them being a savant is no guarantee that you cannot possibly know a subject, there's not a finite amount of knowledge, someone else knowing something doesn't impede you from doing the same.\n\nI get that some people have a hard time learning certain things, but without accounting for actual physical and mental disabilities, you're making statements about impossibilities rather than difficulties. I'm absolutely shite at math, I cannot stand it and it doesn't like me much either. But there's not some invisible forcefield in between me and the capacity to learn it. If someone offered me a billion dollars to learn some maths, I'd learn some maths. It'd be hard, but it certainly wouldn't be impossible.\n\n>It sounds paralyzing to me. It can be emotionally devastating to confront the full scope of your limitations, especially in a world where people are constantly evaluated and compared against each other. \n\nI'm not taking the piss or trying to be a little stinker here, this is genuine: I think this point says more about your own internal emotional reality than that of the realities of the general public. This sounds like pretty textbook anxiety and would be a question far better unpacked by a psychologist than a Reddit thread.\n\nYes, comparisons can be hard for anyone. But no, the vast majority of people are not wandering about the place with a paralytic fear of comparisons.\n\n>The Dunning-Kruger effect could be a protective force by allowing people to view themselves through a slightly more optimistic lens.\n\nIt's not an internal force, it's an external pattern observation. Dunning-Krueger effect isn't inherent in people, it's an observation made about people. The internal force here being observed is essentially a truism about how ignorance functions. The more you are ignorant of, the less capacity you have to understand how ignorant you are. \n\nFor instance: you knowing that French exists, makes you capable of knowing you don't know French. Someone who has never heard of France wouldn't know they didn't know French because they don't even know it exists at all. Neither you nor and this person know French, but you know you don't.\n\nIt's not a protective mechanism, it's an epistemological observation. It has nothing to do with biology, even a dog or an alien would show Dunning-Krueger-esque traits; certainly in the ignorance begets ignorance bit, possibly in the bravado bit. Also humans as animals have raised to our position of power through intelligence above any other physical trait (because the brain is physical). We're crap hunters, and we're incredibly easy to kill. Intelligence is our biggest asset by such a ridiculous margin. Being particularly good at being idiots would be a terrible evolutionary trait. \n\n>This could encourage them to try new things, take risks, and maintain the confidence necessary to improve themselves.\n\nOr to do dumb dangerous shit.

Even disruptors and game changers tend to have strong working knowledge of the fields they disrupt. They tend to know the rules and why the rules exists before they break them.

    "I think you, like most Europeans, badly misunderstand how race relations work in the USA. I say this as an American who\u2019s lived in the EU (Austria) for the last 20 years, who\u2019s spent considerable time in both the USA and Europe. \nIf you watch European TV, (or whatever news) you would get the impression that the USA is a non-stop race riot. \nThis impression is wrong, especially if you go to a big city like Los Angeles, you would see people of every race working together and most of the time getting along.\nThe communities are way more integrated than you would imagine as well, this is not just minorities barely making it. They have real political and economic power, the mayor of Los Angeles, for example, is a black woman, and she is not the first black or minority mayor. The same goes for many U.S. cities. You will have many Black, Latino, and Asians that are in highly-skilled jobs, such as CEO\u2019s, doctors, engineers, and lawyers. The president of my university was black, and this was in the 1990\u2019s.\nI say all of this because it seems to me that Europeans have this idea that blacks and other minorities are all poor and are all struggling to barely get by. This is not that case.\n\nThe problems the USA are currently having are dealing with the history of slavery and oppression of minorities in the distant and recent past. The current \u201cconversation\u201d is how best to deal with the systematic racism and policies that have kept minorities poor. Cities with large (mostly black) populations have endemic problems such as lack of educational opportunities, and high unemployment, mostly due to structurally racist policies.\n\nThe USA is rapidly changing in terms of demographics, the USA is currently about 58% \u201cwhite\u201d with various minorities making up a 42% of the population. These groups are complex and have their own dialogues (such as the use of the \u201cn word\u201d which is a heated discussion in the black community and not ok with many African Americans)\n\nI think the changes in American society are huge and the discussions and disagreements are trying to decide what the USA will be in the future.\nIt\u2019s a decidedly different set of problems than what is happening in Europe. (Which I will say, for all of its problems, the USA is making progress, while Europe as a whole is abjectly failing at dealing with their own changing demographics.)": {

    "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but it\u2019s essential to recognize that the U.S. approach to race is deeply influenced by a unique historical and societal context that differs greatly from Europe\u2019s experience.\n\nRacism in the U.S. isn\u2019t just a social issue but one with roots in centuries of systemic oppression, from slavery to Jim Crow laws to discriminatory housing policies. Each of these shaped communities and opportunities in ways that continue to impact people today. Many people hoped that Obama\u2019s election would signify a \u201cpost-racial\u201d era, but his presidency revealed how unresolved these racial disparities remain. His election was a symbolic milestone, but symbolic changes alone don\u2019t erase deeply embedded societal issues or dismantle the long-standing systems that perpetuate inequality.\n\nIn the U.S., \u201crace\u201d is not a biological reality but a social construct historically created to justify exploitation and discrimination. Racial categories emerged to rationalize practices like slavery and segregation, creating disparities that have persisted across generations in areas like wealth, education, and healthcare. Far from being a means to divide people, acknowledging race is a necessary step in understanding and addressing these inequities.\n\nPolicies promoting diversity, such as affirmative action and representation quotas, aim to address the barriers that have kept marginalized groups out of influential spaces. These policies don\u2019t reinforce division; they challenge the unfair advantage that certain groups have historically held by making spaces more accessible to underrepresented voices. Representation matters because, for many years, minorities were excluded from these spaces altogether. This isn\u2019t about rigidly categorizing people\u2014it\u2019s about providing fairer opportunities and recognizing the benefits of diverse perspectives.\n\nThe complexity of reclaimed terms, such as the \u201cN-word,\u201d can be challenging to understand from an outside perspective. In Black communities, reclaiming this term transforms a painful history into an expression of solidarity and resilience. Reclaiming language used historically as a weapon is an act of agency and empowerment, not an attempt to perpetuate racism. Just because certain terms are reclaimed by those they once harmed doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t hurtful or offensive if used outside those communities.\n\nThe U.S. is often described as a \u201cmelting pot,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean that unity in diversity comes easily. Race remains a focal point of American discourse because of the unique, interwoven histories of different communities within the country. In some European countries, national identities are often more culturally homogeneous, so race might not appear as central in discourse. However, the U.S. is built on multiculturalism, which requires directly engaging with each group\u2019s unique history and challenges.\n\nAddressing race openly isn\u2019t what fuels racism. It\u2019s the structures of inequality that persist despite this openness. Ignoring or downplaying these disparities doesn\u2019t make them disappear; it only pushes them further from view. Talking about race is crucial for creating a fairer society. Far from reflecting a rise in racism, America\u2019s focus on race shows an effort to reckon with its history and move toward equity. By facing these challenges directly, the U.S. is not becoming more racist; it\u2019s working to break down the legacy of racial injustice.": {

Cunt as an insult as opposed to endearment is based on the context of personal relationships. Nigger, it is asserted, can be used in the public sphere without the context of friendship solely on the basis of visible race.

    "Racism in the New World and Old World is very different. The racism you see in the US is very similar to racism in Latin America, where it may be even more stratified. The New World European colonies were racially stratified and had slavery built into their very foundations. Europeans back home knew and enabled this racism, they loved the agricultural products slavery provided them, but it was out of sight and out of mind in the colonies. It was much like today how people don\u2019t like to think about how their sneakers might have involved child labor in their production.\n\nEurope is so much more homogeneous, and racial hatred was historically more directed at neighbors of similar skin color. I think this is still evident in the European nations not really being able to act as a unified front and consequently the EU as a collective not having much influence on the world stage. People didn\u2019t start emigrating from former colonies to their European overlords more recently. They were treated more as novelties compared to in the Americas where these racial divisions have been around for centuries. Europe still have its fair share of xenophobia though, and despite all of the anti-immigration rhetoric coming out of the US today, generally has much stricter immigration laws. Even if Turkey had fully Western European style governance, they wouldn\u2019t be let into the EU and the real reason for this is racism and xenophobia.\n\nI think the problem today is that your average racists person has a platform with the internet and social media that they didn\u2019t have before. More racist people existed in the past\u2014there was segregation and people openly slurring and disparaging other races and those were people who had influence and a platform back in the day.

    "I can not even remotely believe that I am about to defend apple or large corporations like it, but:\n\nApple is (not technically but go with it) a concept founding company. They \"invented\" the smartphone and seriously brought it to market. You could argue that simply being the \"first\" doesn't entitle a business to a large portion of the market- but it does speak volumes to consumers in terms of reputation; Proctor and Gamble invented modern laundry detergent in the form of Tide (1930ish), which basically controls the market in terms of formula even today because its what people know. \n\nSecondly, the 60% control that apple holds is a number that would be really negative to consumer perception if broken up. People don't buy apple products because they are better or cheaper - they buy them because of status. Apple has done wonders, making people think that they are the high class phones of America and everyone who's anyone should have one. Apple is a fashion statement, not high-tech. Tesla was inspired by this approach with their old roadster, giving many of the supercars away at no cost to VIPS nearly a decade before bringing a consumer car to market just so people would really want them. If you broke up the monopoly, consumers would be upset because they wouldn't be buying the same phone anymore. Say you had a hypothetical (extremely unrealistic) breakup of the company where it was split evenly between software, phones, and other tech (mac books, airpods, etc): now people are upset that their apple iPhone, pear computer, and strawberry headphones don't go together, don't sync up as well, and don't mean anything in a lineup. \n\n20% as a metric for monopoly is a pretty arbitrary number. Lots of companies have huge market shares and no-one would ever think to complain: AT&T controls practically every 1st party Internet cable in the country, Walmart has a ~70% share and isn't exceedingly underfire (for being large), Dean foods doesn't publicly release their numbers but has their hand in ~70-90% of dairy products. I use these specific monopolys not as examples of why monopolys are good, but why they exist: people like the company's. \n\nYou list that over 200 phone companies exist, which seems to imply that they should be roughly equal- why? Motorola doesn't make the same quality phones as Samsung or Apple? Some phones ( a lot) are built to be disposable and cheap, but most people are willing to spend more to get something better when it is as ubiquitous as a cellphone. Apple has the share over those 200 company's not because they are being starved by apple, but because they can not come up with a product to beat it.": {

If the total revenue is higher than total costs, the monopolists will make abnormal profits.\n\nPrice maker: Decides the price of the good or product to be sold, but does so by determining the quantity in order to demand the price desired by the firm.\n\nHigh barriers to entry: Other sellers are unable to enter the market of the monopoly.\n\nSingle seller: In a monopoly, there is one seller of the good, who produces all the output.[6] Therefore, the whole market is being served by a single company, and for practical purposes, the company is the same as the industry.\n\nPrice discrimination: A monopolist can change the price or quantity of the product. They sell higher quantities at a lower price in a very elastic market, and sell lower quantities at a higher price in a less elastic market.\n\n__\n\nNone of this is really true, as far as I can tell.": {

    "Linguist here.\n\nUnforunately you are wrong and u/tuckernutter is right on this one.\n\n>You do understand that the reason we come up with these classifications is for clear communication right?\n\nSpecifically clear communication amongst scientists, who often speak in a register of English that is more specific and regulated that the average person. Because when you are sloppy with words in science it leads to worse results.\n\nBut the average petson does not speak formal English, and is not using the highly accurate meaning of scientific jargon.\n\nIn informal language (and even semi-formal) we choose words that are close enough. There is no ultimate authority over what words mean - we often actually determine meaning via context (if I say 'come look at this bug' and there is a spider, the context provides you with the information to determine that I mean the spider) and we reach a general consensus via use and discussion.\n\nThe meaning of words is also not set in stone and evolves over time. One way this can happen is something called semantic drift (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\\_change). One example listed there is \"nice\" which used to mean 'foolish, ignorant, frivolous, senseless' - but people slowly began using it in different contexts until it became a word with positive associations.\n\nFurthermore words do not have precise definitions in peoples' mind - they have semantic ranges and associations. That is to say that you don't actually have a strict definition of \"tree\" in your head - you have a series of memories that you know are of trees and properties you associate to trees (tall, bark, leaves, plant, roots, stationary). Definitions in dictionaries are an attempt to capture this, but do so imperfectly and should be referenced not as the be all and end all of language - but instead as an attempt at capturing the meaning. Something being on the edge of a definition doesn't make it not the thing, because semantic ranges and associations can be bent to incorporate edge cases. If in fiction there was a big thing that looked like a tree but was actually an animal then you would in fact instinctively and coherently call it a \"tree\" and it would be *close enough*... or the ents from LOTR are still trees despite the fact that in LOTR they are able to walk about (which trees cannot actually do).\n\nPoint is OP is correct in that \"bug\" in informal and semi-formal English refers to things that are not scientifically classified as insects.": {

For Kamala Harris, or any Democratic candidate, to win the electoral college while losing the popular vote would actually be a major departure from historical trends. The electoral college generally favors Republicans because of how voters are spread out geographically; smaller states and rural areas have more electoral influence, which has typically benefited Republican candidates, as we saw with George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016. So, if a Democrat were to pull off an electoral college win, they\u2019d almost certainly take the popular vote as well.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s true that Trump has surprised pollsters before, polling methods have adapted since 2016. Many pollsters are now better at accounting for his base, meaning his previous edge over the polls might be more muted this time around. Add to that his divisive political style, and it\u2019s challenging to see him significantly expanding his support beyond his core followers.\n\nEconomic concerns are real, and some voters do associate inflation and economic struggles with Democrats. But recent polling shows that the public doesn\u2019t overwhelmingly trust Trump on the economy either. Inflation and global instability aren\u2019t issues unique to the U.S.; they\u2019re global problems. Voters may be wary of attributing these entirely to one party or administration, especially given that the economy\u2019s recent challenges are tied to the pandemic and broader global shifts.\n\nAnd contrary to your expectation of low turnout, we\u2019ve actually seen record-high turnout in recent elections, especially when Trump is on the ballot. Polarizing candidates tend to drive people to vote, not discourage them. While many Americans are frustrated with both major parties, this frustration often pushes them to the polls rather than keeping them home. Independent candidates may attract some disillusioned voters, but history shows they rarely pull enough to change the balance of the electoral college, especially with the logistical hurdles they face in getting on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats are indeed focusing heavily on swing states, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re ignoring the wider electorate. Campaigns today are highly data-driven, allowing them to target key areas while still making broad appeals nationally. Plus, Democrats have built up a strong mobilization infrastructure over several election cycles, which could be a big asset if high turnout continues. Their attention to swing states likely suggests confidence in the popular vote and a focused push where the electoral college matters most.\n\nFinally, demographic shifts in crucial states like Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan are making them more competitive for Democrats, especially in urban and suburban areas. These shifts make it harder for Republicans to count on their traditional rural strongholds to secure the electoral college. If these trends hold, it\u2019s much more likely that a Democratic candidate who wins the electoral college would also win the popular vote.\n\nSo, while Trump\u2019s base is energized, the structure of the electoral college still tends to favor Republicans. If a Democrat does win the electoral college, they\u2019re almost certain to take the popular vote, too.

    "You make sense and it's easy to understand where you're coming from but I'm in line with what everyone has said about all relationships (outside of the parent child relationship mostly) being transactional is true. It was a hard pill to swallow even for me but as the proverb goes \"good medicine taste bad\". It makes the relationship feel cold and lose the warmth we've attributed to them over the years but they've always been about business where the negotiations may be implicitly or explicitly stated. \n\nDr. Orion Taraban explains this concept really well in his book \"The Value of Others\" and on his Youtube Channel. \n\nThe thing about the transaction is that the healthier the relationship, and the more virtues (love, trust, and honesty) transferred within them, the more invisible the transaction is but the transaction is still there. \n\nA way to think about it is that we as people don't deal or move to people that we don't get anything out of. We can't provide for ourselves in all ways so we move to others to get the things we need. Relationships are the medium in which value is exchanged so we can get those necessities. Value means anything worth paying for, and payment is the expenditure of resources in the form of time, energy, money, and attention. \n\nThe most traditional transaction in a heterosexual romantic relationship has been when a woman exchanges sexual opportunity (which women have historically and presently control access to) for resources and men exchange resources (which they've historically controlled access to) for sex. This seems to be the case in the relationship you described above between Bill Belichick and the 23 y/o. They are two consenting adults and the transaction feels more visible and cold because the public probably can't see any of the \"warmth\" in the relationship. Warmth once again being the virtues (love, honesty, and trust etc.)  in which can be transferred (not transacted) between two people. The power imbalance through the gaps you mentioned and the age definitely exasperates the issue as well but foundationally the \"transaction\" being there isn't the problem.": {

Suddenly black people could go anywhere white people went, even your kids schools. You couldn't discriminate against them (openly) anymore. Women could get their own credit cards, control their own fertility with the pill, and have careers. \n\nA lot of people did not like these changes. In fact, the modern Republican party, since Nixon or Reagan, depending how you figure, has simply been one big backlash against those changes. \n\nIt was around this time that Republicans turned against the government they felt had betrayed them. They have since that time been against every policy that might materially benefit average Americans because now it included *them*. (This incidentally is why we don't have nice things like universal healthcare, paid family leave, and free child care. In case you've wondered.) \n\nIt was around this same time that the evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion. Prior to this it was just a Catholic issue and didn't really rise to the level of a national political issue. But the desire to control women is very strong. If it can't find a socially acceptable outlet, it will find an underground one. Thus, the pro-life movement was born. \n\nIt was around this same time that the NRA went from being a gun safety outfit to a hair-on-fire gun rights lobbying group. \n\nRepublicans have resisted every bit of social progress over the last few decades. But the rest of us carried on with it. Eventually we elected a black man president. Then a woman seemed sure to be president next. Plus gays can get married now and you're supposed to treat them like straight couples!\n\nAlong comes Trump. Aside from being vulgar and stupid, the only thing he really had to offer that other candidates did not was his open racism and misogyny. And people loved it. Finally! Someone has come to defend and preserve white supremacy and patriarchy. That is what MAGA means, after all. \n\nBut the problem is, these ideas aren't popular enough to win national office. (Unless you have the help of Putin and Comey, without which he never would have won in 2016.) What these folks really want is to seize power and establish minority rule, if they can't have their way democratically. \n\nAnd the bogus \"stolen election\" bullshit is nothing but a permission structure that they have erected so that they can still think of themselves as the heroes, the patriotic Americans, instead of the fascist villains they really are.\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of what is going on.": {

    "> A common argument against Voter ID laws is that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.\n\nI'm left-wing American and I'm not *inherently* against Voter ID laws, but they need to come under these provisos:\n\n**#1. American citizens and non-citizens need to be provided these IDs ~FOR FREE~. (Only citizens can use them to vote, voting eligible ones can have a special mark or something.)**\n\nThe cost of a driver's license is $10-$89 depending on the state you live in. It can then cost $50 to renew that license, and must be renewed every five years.\n\nIf you make these IDs the backbone of our voting system, congratulations -- [you have implemented a poll tax.](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/constitutional-amendments-amendment-24-elimination-poll-taxes) The only way to ensure fair and equal access under an ID system is to make the ID free, and...\n\n**#2. It is the onus of the government to provide their constituents with these IDs.**\n\nThis is basically the main reason I don't generally support voter ID laws. I believe every American citizen should vote -- in fact, I believe that we should have a [compulsory voting system like Australia.](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout-database/compulsory-voting) I don't know if everyone would follow me on that one. But! If we are to add another hurdle to voting, the burden should be on the government to lessen that load. \n\nBut I do not trust the US Government to take the steps necessary to make these ID laws not a burden. \n\nLet's say you have to go to a DMV to get these licenses. Who is to say that a Republican state senate in Alabama couldn't shut down DMVs in predominantly Black neighbors to suppress the vote? (Or vice versa in a blue state, but [Alabama has a recent and egregious history of racially targeted voter suppression](https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-happening-alabamas-redistricting-post-milligan) )\n\n Which leads to...\n\n**#3. Universal Voter Registration at age 18 for citizens.**\n\nSuch a no-brainer and it should exist already. I think any Voter ID law that comes to the table without this already should be laughed out of congress. If you'd like to opt OUT of (or update) your voter registration, you can fill out a form to do so -- but every American should be opted into voter registration at the age of 18.": {

    "> Indeed, all life on earth is believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, meaning that the genesis of life on Earth happened only once\n\nI want to challenge this point: All life having evolved from a single common ancestor does not necessarily mean that genesis of life on Earth happened only once. Once life appeared initially and had some opportunity to evolve for its environment, life from that first genesis event had a significant advantage when it comes to competition for resources. If genesis had occurred again later, it's very likely that the resulting life would either have been eaten by more complex life soon after its genesis, or starved due to an inability to compete with more complex life for resources. \n\nI would expect the evidence available to us to look pretty much the same whether the genesis of life on Earth had happened only once, or if it had happened thousands of times over the history of the Earth. Even if genesis were happening at a random point on earth once every 10 years, I'm not sure a dedicate team of scientists could find evidence of it.": {

    "On the other hand, there are assumptions here which can also be examined. For example:\n\n>Indeed, all life on earth is believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, meaning that the genesis of life on Earth happened only once, that does not give a lot of insight into how likely it is to happen.\n\nA single ancestor only means there\u2019s been one successful lineage of life, not that there has only ever been one lineage. We don\u2019t know how life on Earth started. It could be a very common (relatively) occurrence which has failed over and over due to it happening in a location that can\u2019t sustain it. Maybe it has actually successfully happened many times on earth but the result is so basic it looks like everything else?  Point is the current understanding and model can change, and certainly will if we ever get a second data point. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m more of the camp of \u201clife is probably pretty common (as in more than 1% of planets will see some basic life at some point in its millions of years of existence), sustaining it for more than a second or two is probably really uncommon.\u201d": {

    "What evidence do you have about it not being a matter of chance?  We have never observed nor been able to recreate abiogenesis in a lab, so we have no idea how likely or unlikely it is for life to emerge from precursor components.\n\nWe know it is _possible_, sure, but we have no idea what the likelihood is.  That is my point.  The good science has a very robust hypothesis on how life can emerge from precursors, but that hypothesis has never _actually_ been shown to result in life.  \n\nSince we've tried to do it in a lab and _failed_, we know that the precursor conditions are not a certainty that life will emerge.  There is clearly some other element required - maybe it is something unique to Earth or maybe it is just random chance, but there is some other element missing.\n\n>What makes Earth special?\n\nMaybe nothing, maybe something.  We don't know.  But even if Earth isn't special, random chance can make amazing things happen in mundane conditions.  You can shuffle a deck of cards and get a random order, or you can get a royal flush.  That doesn't make the deck of cards or the shuffle special.\n\n**Edit**:  Allow me to also address this:\n\n>We've found life in so many places and in so may conditions on earth.\n\nYou are conflating two different things here:  the initial emergence of life (abiogenesis) and the proliferation of life _once it has already emerged_.  The abundance of life on Earth tells us that life might proliferate quite quickly if/when it emerges in the first place, but that fact tells us nothing about how likely that emergence is to occur.": {

    "I think that the world as it is now is beginning to set up expectations for us to *always* be stimulated and entertained. Advertising is everywhere; it's hypersexualized, and social media has been expertly executed so that it's constantly in our face. We have been trained to believe that happiness is achieved through what we can do, what we can have, and - most importantly - how our experiences compare to others'. It takes quite a bit of deprogramming to move past that. I'm trying, and I'm certainly not there yet.\n\nBut that's not really the world's problem; it's ours. Books are cheap. Beautiful scenery of many types can be found in most all places. Relationships can be formed over a cup of coffee. Skills take discipline, time, and effort, but can be extremely rewarding. An old acoustic guitar for songs, a square piece of paper for origami, a pad of paper and pencil for reflection or story telling require so little capital to acquire.\n\nRich people undoubtedly have it easier - they can ignore many of the pains of this life with the cashing of a check - but expecting money to solve your relationship with this world is foolish. We get used to what we have, and rich people often find themselves bored too.\n\nIn another response you mentioned it's hard to change from your current outlook - and that's so true - but just remember you only have one life. Succumbing to despair and accepting that the world has nothing for you is wasting no one's time but your own. Winning this argument only hurts you in the end.\n\nIf you can afford therapy, I would suggest it. Guidance in how to enjoy life and find happiness can go a long way.

Facebook or Meetup also often has lists of events in your area.\n\nExplore hobbies and crafts. Try an instrument (just get a cheap second hand one), try drawing or knitting or DIY.

You are a participant, not a spectator. No one has a responsibility to curate anything for you. You have to actively choose to make your own life fun. You have to decide what fun means to you, and then you have to make it happen. And if you are creating fun, then it's generally easy to have fun people join and make it even better.

    "There is a lot of mundane shit that one has to do on a regular basis as a human functioning in the world. You have to go to work, clean the kitchen, take the rubbish out, shower frequently, do laundry - these are the foundation stones of monotony in adult life.\n\nBut, those things are not the stuff life is made of, unless they're the only things you do with your time. Even if you only do those basic chores all day every day, you can still make them fun - race the clock to get the cleaning done, have a little dance party whilst cooking. Look for ways to add enjoyment into your life.\n\nWhen I was working in an incredibly boring job, I used to challenge myself each day to figure out how I could actively do something to improve the day for one other person. Sometimes that was making a colleague a coffee, sometimes it was taking pride in my customer facing work, but every day I looked for something I could find meaning in. \n\nI also think that you saying \"people are still people\" indicates the biggest issue you're having, which is social isolation. Almost everybody has something interesting to say, something new to teach you, if you engage with them in an open way. What's beautiful is that people are still people - we are all searching for ways to connect with and understand each other, looking for the meaning in our existence. Try going to a place where people gather and talking to one new person: I moved cities and started walking my dog in a park with a little cafe, and a group of old men (I'm a youngish woman) started chatting to me as I waited for my coffee.

You can start by being in a social place and just listening, and slowly integrate yourself into a conversation.\n\nAlso, it does sound like you might be clinically depressed.

    "Ok so I won't try to change your view in its entirety because I think it would be pointless since we start from two non reconcilable premises (I do not think consenting teenagers having sex BETWEEN THEM is either immoral or irresponsible). I'll try just to bring another perspective by providing a personal anecdote and maybe change your view in a small part. If it's relevant for context, I'm European, 25yo, don't have kids but I do want to start a family in the future.\n\nFor me the whole point of facilitating is harm reduction. When I was 15 I was invited to my first house party and I asked my father for permission to go. He said sure, but on one condition: I'd have to spend a night with him at home the weekend prior to the party. Up until that point I had just had a few sips of alcohol here and there from my parents at, like you say, special meals or events. And tbh I wasn't even that much into it, and wasn't really the kind of teenager interested in drinking and partying and so on.\n\nAnyway, when that night came, he sat with me on the couch and asked me if I was intending to drink at that party, to which I truthfully responded I didn't think so and I wasn't even so sure that would be alcohol involved as far as I knew. He responded that was good, that he knew those kids were responsible but that anyway sooner or later in my life I would encounter a situation where drinking was expected, and explained to me how peer pressure works and why it's bad. He then told me that alcohol is a drug even if it's not colloquially referred to as such and that drugs are just like medicines, meaning they will produce some effect on your body/mind and inevitably have some side effects. While medicines are usually approved and most of them have those side effects scientifically deemed as not (too) harmful (if dosage is respected ofc), drugs are not, and therefore they must be treated with the utmost caution if not entirely avoided, because you could die. He then proceeded to explain to me the different kinds of drugs (psychedelics, stimulants, opioids, delirants, etc) and then focused on alchol, why it's so normalized, why it's so dangerous, why it can be fun if assumed in moderation and what happens if you drink too much.\n\nThen he told me \"but you can't know if you don't try, and I'd much rather you try here with me in a controlled environment where you're safe rather than with other kids your age\". And he offered me a beer. We drank together, talked a bit, played a videogame and so on. A while after I had finished it he asked me how I was feeling, if I enjoyed the effect, if it actually resembled what he told me earlier etc, and then offered me another beer. Again, same things as before and then a third beer. When I had drank about half of it, though, I started to feel like my head was spinning a bit when I got up and also a bit nauseous. I told my dad and he said good, stop drinking. Now remember this feeling, carve it into your head: from here on, the fun ends and bad things start to happen. Now you KNOW how it feels, and you have to stop BEFORE that happens. So at the party if you have 2 beers, you're having fun and a friend tells you to drink another one, you know why you have to say no. It doesn't matter if peer pressure kicks in, THEY will regret it later on, you won't.\n\nThe following week I had a great night, but when at the end I was holding the head of my best friend throwing up on the floor while he was seated on the toilet I remember, as clear as the sky, thinking \"wow, he is  SO fucked up he can't even throw up inside the toilet, this is so disgusting. Thanks dad\". And rest assured, I was pressured into drinking more that night, and I can 100% say I'd have accepted if it wasn't for my dad. I recognized the limit of the \"feeling good\" phase and my only leap of faith was trusting him on how bad and how fast things could develop, to which I had confirmation that same night.\n\n10 years later I can say that I'm one of the few people I know who drinks socially and has never ever in his life vomited/done some stupid shit/had a bad hangover from alcohol. My best friend hasn't as well after that night, but my dad spared me a horrible experience, and I'm thankful. For that night and for his continuous, surely annoying at the time, insisting on moderation and finding the right balance between two extremes.\n\nAs a final remark. I don't think it's helpful to prevent kids from doing dangerous stuff, be it climbing that shelf at 5yo or drinking as a teenager. They'll have to do some not so safe thing sooner or later in their life, and if you always shield them they'll never learn. The important thing is to do anything in your power to make sure your kids are doing dangerous stuff CAREFULLY.": {

    "To me the issue is the way it's advertised and the fact that it's all done through an app, making the layers of friction between you and losing your money almost nonexistent. I live in the rural Midwest where it's pretty common to go to the local Casino as a young adult as a place to socialize since there's not much else to do here. To go there and lose money we had to drive a half hour each way and eventually the friend group you came with would want to leave, so you're only even gonna be there for a few hours to lose money. With sports betting you download an app, sign up for an account and after that you can be gambling within second of pulling out your phone.\n\nThe online/app component also amplifies how many bets you can place and what you are betting on. With a slot machine you pick which lines and how many on each then spin. Sports betting is the equivalent of having 100 slot machines directly in your pocket that you can access simultaneously at any time, there's so many different specific things to bet on with each match it's ridiculous.\n\nThe advertising is definitely a problem too, maybe the biggest one honestly. If we look at the vices we consider morally questionable/in a gray area such as tobacco, alcohol, or traditional gambling, they are not allowed to advertise nearly as brazenly as sports betting currently does. Imagine if you turned on the game on Sunday, and every other Ad was someone chugging beers, smoking darts and/or pulling the lever on slots and saying \"This could be you, look how fun this looks! Don't you want to win money and make friends?\" people would be furious. We actually explicitly prohibit these industries from advertising this way for these exact reasons, especially during programs such as sports games where entire families will almost certainly be watching. So many of these ads have pro athletes saying they use this platform to gamble, directly targeting people who are fans of them, which includes a whole lot of young people.\n\nHonestly there's a few more reasons I'm against it in general too but this is turning into a text wall already lol. but I do think there are differences yeah.": {

    "I can explain, this is a novel and I apologize but god I need to rant about this.\n\nI hung out on 4chan for years because I couldn't find a better place for gaming news. They got too annoying so now I just get less gaming news. I also get less gaming news because youtube keeps insisting I watch 45 year old men scream about pronouns in character creation instead of actual fucking gaming news. So I am well educated on the goings on of these people.\n\nThere's 2 variants with some minor overlap. One is, in my opinion, somewhat reasonable a stance to take, and the other one is so bone stupid it forced me to not know current gaming news. I'll start with that dumb one.\n\n**Dumb one:** \n\nPurely an us versus them mentality. It's an entirely hateful mindset, but not necessarily in the way most people think. While it does almost always lead to real racism and similar, it doesn't start there. It starts with a mix of contrarianism and the feeling of being attacked. I can go into this more if you want, but for now point at hand: woke to them literally means \"Reminds me of thing I associate with bad\". It is 2 steps of separation from the thing they dislike, but communities that use the phrase without irony are echo chambers to a degree people don't notice and get angry when it's pointed out.  For example, some people tried to claim the recent Silent Hill 2 remake was woke because a character wears a different shirt. The shirts are very similar but: \n\n\\[Gaming characters outfit changed\\] -> \\[Outfit changes have been used in the past to reduce booby\\] -PATH A-> \\[Less booby was supported by game journalist that said racist thing toward white men on twitter\\]\n\n\\-PATH B-> \\[Reduced booby means hate straight because journalist, twitter, etc\\]\n\nThus, the new shirt is woke and hates white men on twitter and is part of an agenda to make silent hill 2 fans gay. I am not exaggerating. \n\n**Less dumb one:**\n\nThe best I can describe this is through analogy, an analogy about furry porn, sorry. So as so many great men have said in the past, I'm not a furry, but:\n\nYou know when you're looking at anime boobies and you see some furry stuff mixed in and you go \"Eh, ya okay I could go for that, looks pretty alright even if it's not a big interest\". So then as you're getting through it a blue dog in a surprisingly specific outfit, with surprisingly specific glasses and hairstyle shows up and his name is Simon and he talks about his hobbies and how he's crushing on like, Samantha or whatever. You immediately realize that this was either drawn by, or commissioned by, someone named Simon who has a crush on Samantha and he wears that outfit all the time with those glasses and that hairstyle and he wants to be a blue dog? \n\nThen you feel really gross because Simon has kind of forced you into his thing, like you can sort of smell him through the screen. You don't want to interact with or think about Simon and you go look for your anime tiddies elsewhere? It's like that. You're enjoying some piece of media and then very awkwardly and intrusively a character randomly starts screaming their political views in a near fourth wall breaking way and even if you don't disagree with those views, that writer is a Simon and it feels gross.": {

I\u2019m so curious how this series will end with the last book on the horizon! \n\n**The Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton, by Edith Wharton**: Read with r/bookclub -very ethereal and spooky rather than scary. Wharton knows how to create atmosphere and open-ended scenarios and seriously haunted houses!

I'm kinda sick of reading books where women have their big moments in their twenties - I want to know there's still time to have adventures at any ages. I would prefer the older the woman, the better. That being said, I enjoyed The Blue Castle by LM Montomery (considering most of the book is the protagonist's family calling her past her prime at the old age of 28). Other books that I've read in the same vein are: The Switch by Beth O'Leary; The Remarkable Retirement of Edna Fisher by EM Anderson; My Life in France by Julia Child; and Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes.

Both Cathy and Chris were extremely traumatized and practically groomed to act sexual with each other. \n\nCathy displayed such realistic trauma responses after they escaped. The food hoarding, the choosing bad partners, the undying rage against her abusers. Even the repeating of history at the end of the series. \n\nChris\u2019s trauma made him create a self fulfilling prophecy of what the grandmother blamed them of doing. He saw himself as broken and unlovable, and that Cathy was the replacement for Corrine\u2019s love. He loved his mother, and hated himself for it. He also blamed Cathy for looking like Corrine. Chris would never give himself the ability to open himself to anyone else. \n\nCarrie, I think is the biggest victim in the situation. Corrine favored Chris because he worshipped her, was jealous of Cathy for being loved by Chris sr, Cory and Carrie were just burdens she never even seemed to care about. \n\nChris and Cathy seemed to forget about her, and Cathy put her in danger because of her own reckless behavior.

    ">why exactly was it that the Emperor landed to Arrakis with his retinue? \n\nIf I may nerd out for a minute here: the Spice was one of the most important items of trade in the galaxy, and it's production had been on a steep decline for about two or three years at that point, first because the Harkonnens had sabotaged Atreides production, and then because Paul was waging a merciless war of attrition again them. The council of nobility, one of the three legs of the tripod that governed the galaxy, was aware to a limited extent, albeit not officially, of the Emperor's role in supporting the Harkonnens and thus in causing the decline, which harmed them economically. The Spacing Guild, the second leg of the tripod which, according to Paul, only let the Emperor ascend his throne after promising to keep Spice flowing, also knew about the Imperial treachery, since they had been paid to ship in Imperial troops. So, the Imperial House, the final leg of the tripod, was facing some serious animosity from the other two legs, and needed to demonstrate an immediate correction, and the Emperor's presence for that correction was somewhat demanded to ensure accountability.\n\n>No one cares about the military skills of an emperor, as long as he has reliable commanders, no?\n\nThis is another reason why the Emperor needed to be there. The Imperial House, much like the Ottoman Dynasty upon which they are at least partially based, came to power on the basis of their prowess as military commanders of elite units. The Emperor himself regularly appeared at state functions wearing the symbols of his direct command over his elite forces. And, most importantly, the reputation of those elite forces as being unstoppable is what gave the Imperial House it's continued ascendancy, despite being grossly outnumbered by the rest of the Imperium. So, the Emperor's own position on his throne very much did rest on his military skills, and the fact that his forces had been matched or bested by Paul's Fremen (this was a closely guarded secret, naturally), meant that his position was threatened, and any defeat in front of the galactic nobility and the Spacing Guild during such a serious crisis would have seriously threatened his throne. It was pretty necessary for him to take personal command during the crisis, especially since this would (and did) inspire his forces, which were indoctrinated with quasi-religious zeal for the Imperial House, to fight all the harder. \n\n(Sorry, this is just one of my favorite books, and I love being able to nerd out about the lore and stuff.)": {

    "The term Magical Realism (_lo real maravilloso_), as coined by Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, used to refer to a specific literary mode in which the (real or seemingly) supernatural was brought into the mundane in a way that didn\u2018t let it stand out. The supernatural isn\u2019t something important to the plot, it isn\u2018t something that can be utilised by the characters. It\u2018s just another vagary of life.  \n\nToday, Magical Realism has lost most of its original meaning. It\u2018s used to refer to anything and everything that\u2018s sorta realistic but also has supernatural elements. South American authors especially are often wrongly placed in that category just because the genre\u2018s origins lay there (looking at you Borges).  \n\nFor someone who\u2018s a fan of the og kind of magical realism, that makes it incredibly frustrating to try and find new magical realism authors and books.": {

    "From what I've always been taught, magical realism is a work that takes extraordinary circumstances, but treats them as normal in a realistic setting. For example, let's say there's a book about a mundane small town where humans can understand animals. If this book is magical realism, then that trait would be represented without explanation. A character could be walking down the street, overhear a dog's thoughts and just go to the grocery store. The origin of this phenomenon is not explained or recognized as \"different\" or \"special.\" It just is. Now, if this same book was a fantasy or sci-fi book, there would probably be a lot of exposition to explain why humans can suddenly understand animals, usually relating to some curse, order, or in the case of dystopian novels, a catastrophic event that forever changed the way our society works. It can be confusing to truly define the genre, but I hope this helps in some way!": {

The protagonist, Vanessa, is totally unreliable in the sense that she is completely blinded by her predatory relationship with her teacher. In her mind, she sees nothing wrong with what he is doing to her. She thinks it\u2019s love. very disturbing, yet emotionally gripping read.

    "A true unreliable narrator (rather than a \"twist\" narrator) should present the facts honestly while interpreting them unreliably. So you never feel cheated but can feel uncomfortable or intrigued. \n\nI'm not sure but I think the first such narrator where it's clearly a literary device rather than a fable is The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford. It starts as a kind of standard Pride and Prejudice style comedy of manners but then you realise he is covering for the fact that he has been cuckolded...and then it starts adding layers.

The plot itself could've had a lot more complexity and depth if Collins had gone for third person omniscient narrator but I LOVE that she chose to do it first person.

    "Hello readers and writers!\n\nI have a new book out (October 2024) that will be of interest to anyone writing a novel or thinking about getting started! It\u2019s called ***The One Week Writing Workshop: 7 Days to Spark, Boost or Revive Your Novel.*** It\u2019s designed as a workshop that you do over the course of seven days, (or at your own pace, of course!)\u2014a workshop you can toss in your bag and do anywhere! I give you a fun, inspiring series of real-world writing exercises that we do together and that walk you through every step of the novel writing process from start to finish. By the book\u2019s end, you\u2019ll have learned a reliable method for getting your own novel written as well as new tools to inspire and \u201cunstick\u201d you in your future projects!\n\nMy name is Karin Adams and I\u2019m a traditionally published author of five novels. I also started developing and teaching creative writing workshops in 2010, around the time my first book was published. I discovered a passion for guiding and inspiring others in the writing process and have now worked with thousands of writers of all backgrounds.\u00a0\n\nThere are a few unique features about my book that I think you\u2019ll love. A lot of writing guides break down the product\u2014the novel itself\u2014and try to explain how to shape your ideas into a book. I\u2019m approaching novel-writing from the other end\u2014I break down the *process* of writing a novel and invite you to join me with the very first inkling of your idea (or if you don\u2019t have one, I have exercises to draw this out of you!). We start writing together right away as you read, exploring and learning the process and growing your ideas into something polished and special.\n\nI\u2019m a positive and enthusiastic person by nature, and I truly believe that anyone with a desire to write a novel can do it\u2014so that\u2019s the vibe of this book! I\u2019m going to encourage you and make things fun. Writing can be hard, but we\u2019re going to find the wonder and magic in it together\u2014*that\u2019s* our fuel to keep at it and keep going! So, if this kind of approach appeals to you, I think you\u2019ll enjoy this book and get some great use out of it!\n\nIf you\u2019ve always wanted to write a novel and want some practical guidance, or you\u2019re a veteran writer looking to recharge yourself and get a fresh perspective, please check out my book!\n\nMy Goodreads link: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217544003-the-one-week-writing-workshop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217544003-the-one-week-writing-workshop)\n\n\u00a0Full book details are available on my author website: [https://www.karinadams.com](https://www.karinadams.com)": {

    "GRRM is, for all intents and purposes, a success story. I've really grown and evolved in my feelings on this over the years, but...you can't force someone to finish a story, and no one could accuse him of sitting on his hands and doing *nothing*. He does exactly what he wants, for better or for worse. I imagine he's always done things this way.\n\nHis incredibly nerdy books became one of the most important shows in modern media history, before collapsing in on themselves due to an entirely different creative team's problems with fame and popularity. (Seriously: The worst we can accuse GRRM of is Writing Too Slowly. But D&D, the showrunners? They rushed and cut short a hit series so they could try and make a Star War, and fucked up so badly they lost the gig in the end anyway!)\n\nBut then he took what's essentially a *collection of worldbuilding notes and fanwiki entries* and turned it into a second, smash-hit prequel series, this time with far more creative involvement. He has a cordial relationship with fans, he has his hobbies, he does things for charity, and he continues to contribute to his world in the ways that seem to interest him the most. I feel like this is pretty similar to how we'd see Tolkien conduct himself if he were around today, you know?\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think you named my actual answer: **Patrick Rothfuss.** Because...at least GRRM wrote 3 books before his pace slowed down significantly. And GRRM has always been frank and honest about his progress (or lack thereof) when it comes to his work. But Rothfuss? Where do I even *start*?\n\nHe followed up a phenomenal and promising first book with a flabby, meandering, and oftentimes embarrassing second book. We joke about his main character **Learning Sexomancy From The Goddess Of Sex So He Can Out-Sex The Sex Ninjas**, but...that's all shit that literally happens.\n\nHe insisted from day one in the text and outside of it that the Kingkiller Chronicle would be a trilogy. Some years after the 2nd book, he clarified that it's actually \"A trilogy setting up the first part of the wider story.\" Okay.\n\nHis use of charity funds and relationship to his fan community is *incredibly sketchy* at best, and it continues to give me a real sense of a dude languishing in the glory days.\n\nFinally, I think what's most insulting about Rothfuss is the work he has put out in the meantime. It would be *incredibly* generous to call them novellas, because I know a writing exercise when I see one. It's the literary equivalent of a filler episode, short stories digging into the backstories of characters we don't know enough about to love, framed like they're lovingly-crafted works of fan service. \"Finally, I'll know what Bast and Auri were up to before they met Kvothe!\" said *no one but Patrick Rothfuss*.\n\nSay what you will about GRRM, but he got his shit together enough for HBO to bankroll the most expensive show ever made (at that time) behind his work and his brand. And the powers that be were ready to do the exact same for Rothfuss; just a few years ago, people like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sam Raimi were attached to write original songs and direct episodes, respectively. All of this evaporated because you cannot plan a series around an unfinished trilogy that has essentially positioned its final book as The Thing That Will Make It All Make Sense. A Song of Ice and Fire had a lot more for its showrunners to work with, even when it was just 3 books with 4th on the horizon. Rothfuss' inability to produce has literally cost him a prestige adaptation. We're in a Rings of Power and Wheel of Time world now (to say nothing of House of the Dragon), and I don't know if there's room for a Kingkiller Chronicle series. Again, I have to imagine this is on Rothfuss.\n\nMaybe it's just me. But I can see where GRRM struggles; the story he had in his mind has been shared and told, and he seems to be finding joy in charting new paths. The Hedge Knight stories are some of his finest writing, and the most recent one dropped just before A Dance With Dragons. He still knows and loves this world, and seems to be trying to find ways to tell stories that still interest him and let him do his thing.\n\nMeanwhile, I feel like Rothfuss is frozen in place with a classic case of overpromising and underdelivering. We've all read a fanfic that promises The Most Epic Conclusion In The History Of Epicness, and then falls flat simply because the author's skills and imagination cannot bridge that gap. I think Rothfuss was such a good storyteller in that first book that he fooled *himself* into believing he could capture everything he was hinting at. And then when it came time to make the legends real, he realized he was mostly writing horny pulp fantasy about The Coolest Boy Ever.\n\nAnd again: *That can work.* I've read all of the Dresden Files; I'm totally fine with pulpy, one-note fantasy adventures, imperfectly written with passion and energy. But Rothfuss refuses to even commit to that; he's promised the world, and that's all he can really do now. Promise, and pray that he'll figure out how to make those promises a reality.": {

    "I don't know if he was always this way, but Andrzej Sapkowski, the author of the Witcher series of novels was offered a percentage of shares or a lump sum by CD Projekt to adapt his novels into the Witcher games. He ended up taking the lump sum which was worth around $9000 and got super salty when Witcher 3 hit it big because he didn't expect the games to do well. In fact, he was even offered royalties but refused because he had so little faith in the games.\n\nHe later started bad mouthing the games saying things like \"they ruined the novels and made people uninterested in them\" and eventually sued.\n\nDmitry Glukhovsky, author of the Metro series (which also was adapted into video games) later commented on it and called Sapkowski arrogant; pointing out that the games would have increased interest in his novels.\n\nWrapping this all back around, I feel like Sapkowski got more popular because the game adaptations drew more attention to him and his books and he started behaving badly afterwards. If I recall correctly, some people have also said his novels started to dip in quality after the Witcher 3 came out but I haven't read any of his novels so I don't actually know. But yeah, increased fame may have effected him both attitude wise and creatively.\n\nSource: [https://www.vg247.com/the-witcher-author-thinks-the-games-have-lost-him-book-sales-metro-2033-author-says-this-is-totally-wrong](https://www.vg247.com/the-witcher-author-thinks-the-games-have-lost-him-book-sales-metro-2033-author-says-this-is-totally-wrong)": {

He\u2019s still a child in an environment where racism is so normalised that he doesn\u2019t understand the gravity of it yet.\n\nThat said, I do think Twain is quite bad at endings! He doesn\u2019t know how to end a book, a lot of them just stop, no denouement. It will be full blown action and then he\u2019ll tack on one sentence like \u201cand then they all went home\u201d.

    "Most likely, you are right in the first paragraph. Tom  is a boy who grows up with his aunt and in a world where everything is fine and everything is a fairy tale. He is prone to romanticism and fantasies. Because he is a child and all the adults around him consider racism normal, and even victims of racism consider it the norm. He is inspired by stories about pirates, escapes and so on.\nWhile Finn is a child whose father is an alcoholic and an abuser, he literally lived on the street for a while. What is comfort for others is torment for him. He is not used to the framework, comfort and is less influenced by adults. He has seen a lot of bad things in his life and he is more down-to-earth in his fantasies and understandings of life. He is still a child, but the framework of his living conditions makes him think deeper and simpler. \nAnd in my opinion, Tom Sawyer and Finn are two opposite people in thought, and Mark Twain shows it.": {

By the time the story ends, Huck's meanness and real-world experiences have actually made him mature past Tom. He's a new attitude in America who has begun to understand how painfully evil slavery is and has a personal stake in ending it.\n\nThat said, and to answer your question, I think that Stephen King is the master of telling a good story with a horrible ending. Some of his short stories are good, but his novels... I'm almost always disappointed with the endings. 'The Stand' was a brilliant character-driven novel, but the ending was anticlimactic. 'The Shining' was intriguing and horrifying, but the ending was absurd. 'Hearts in Atlantis' was moving, but the ending felt like a truck engine-braking.

    "Literary, in this context, usually refers to literature with themes of the human experience and ideas. A lot of fiction does this to some level, but for literary fiction it\u2019s the point, not just the plot. It also is more concerned with prose and language itself. \n\nI haven\u2019t read a lot of classics yet but the ones I have definitely earned the title. The biggest benefit for me has been more thought provoking reads. I still enjoy a lot of contemporary fiction though. They can evoke similar thoughts and feelings as classics, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s so many more modern works than there are the relatively small pool of what are widely considered classics, so it\u2019s less likely to run into a future classic. \n\nI don\u2019t pay much attention to \u2018best sellers\u2019 lists": {

    "I think the easier way to divide it is \"literary fiction\" vs \"genre fiction\".\n\nBoth literary and genre fiction can be high quality or turgid crap, both can be profound and emotionally engaging or rubbish and formulaic, both can be groundbreaking art or by the numbers commercialism. This is not about the quality of the writing. It's about the intent behind it. \n\nAt heart, genre fiction exists to tell a story in a distinct, separate world. Literary fiction tries to be part of a shared human story in this world.There is also some crossover of course - Never Let Me Go is both sci-fi and literary fiction; War and Peace is both a historical adventure romp and literary fiction. This happens when the author both wants to tell a good story in a distinct world and show how it reflects a shared story in our world.\n\nI read a lot of genre fiction, mainly sci-fi and historical adventure stories.

    "At least for me, literary fiction and non-literary fiction serve quite different roles (basically the difference between watching something like Black Mirror vs. Gossip Girl).\n\nThese are somewhat personal definitions, but I consider a book literary fiction if it shifts my perspective on the world in some fundamental way \u2014 it has \"depth,\" as you put it, in the sense that it adds a dimension to my understanding of the world and the human experience. There is  significant intention and thought behind the prose, characters/relationships, and concepts that the author writes.\n\nNon-literary fiction is often much more plot-focused and is easier to get into and often, more enjoyable to read. A lot of what you're seeing on the \"bestseller\" lists falls into this category because of the accessibility. Examples: A Court of Thorns and Roses, Fourth Wing, novels by Dan Brown, novels by Colleen Hoover (e.g. It Ends With Us). I find myself reading more non-literary fiction when I'm already overwhelmed by other things in my life because I don't have to use my brain to read it and can just enjoy the ride.\n\n**Some of my favorite (readable + have depth) relatively-modern lit fic novels:**\n\n* Kazuo Ishiguro's novels. ***Remains of the Day*** and ***Never Let Me Go*** are the most well-known. RotD is a masterpiece in its subtle tension and >!unreliable!< narrator/character unveiling, but the themes in NLMG had a greater emotional impact on me. My personal favorite is probably *An Artist of the Floating World,* but it makes sense to start with the more well-known ones because they're definitely not lacking in any way lol.\n* Kurt Vonnegut's works are basically absurdist satires, and can be quite humorous while having tons of \"depth.\" I'd say you should start with ***Slaughterhouse Five*** if you're interested in philosophizing on war or ***Cat's Cradle*** if you want an exploration of religion and science.\n* ***I Who Have Never Known Men***\\*:\\* Fairly short read that packs a punch. I started it with the intention of reading like 20 pages and then didn't get up from my seat for 4 hours.\n* ***The Secret History*** by Donna Tartt: Brilliant character work, but can be a little slow in the middle. \"Dark academia\" in the sense of highlighting the privilege of obsessing over abstract concepts.": {

Take your pick. I think the novel is good partly because it can be read in different ways and still provide plenty of food for thought.\n\nFrankenstein may seem like an unlikeable character who doesn't act maturely and refuses to be held accountable, but if you look deeper, that's also what many of us do, in both small and big ways, in our lives.

    "It is similar to the role of a Child Life Specialist but only because gaming lands in their lap to manage.  Their training and education is not in gaming or the use of games as part of therapy.  For people who don't have experience in a Children's Hospital Child Life Specialists are what distinguish them from adult hospitals; both have Doctors who diagnose you, Nurses who treat you but Child Life Specialists help meet children on an age appropriate level to help explain their diagnosis and prep them for procedures, and to help provide opportunities for play to help normalize life as much as they can for the kiddos they are taking care of.\n\nBecause they are the ones who provide play, the management of gaming systems falls on their responsibility list in the majority of hospitals.  So if a system has a problem they are the ones who are asked to fix it, if someone donates a VR headset they are the ones expected to roll it out.  Because this is not their training this often means that systems stay \"broken\" for something as simple as resyncing controllers to a console, and VR may just sit in the box.  \n\nChildren's hospitals also have Art and Music Therapists who are specially trained to bring art and music bedside to patients.  Since 2017 Child's Play has been funded 48 positions in Children's Hospitals to put Gaming and Technology Specialists in the hospital to work along side the Child Life Specialists.  This game tech model is what the Gamer in Residence position at Glasgow is modeled off of, they just funded it themselves and we are so excited for that.\n\nKnowing that Child Life Specialists do not often identify as gamers, along with these positions we have also created a Therapeutic Video Game Guide (gametherapy.org) that helps break down the different components of games that help address symptoms kids are dealing with in the hospital like pain and anxiety.  I would encourage everyone to check it out, it is not just for hospitalized kiddos.\n\nYou can learn more about what Child's Play Charity is doing and about these Game Tech positions with a bunch of the videos we have on our YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@ChildsPlayCharity/videos).  We even have videos from symposiums we have hosted to further educate and share the impact that gaming is having inside Children's Hospitals.": {

Similar to rubber banding AI where they will start hitting times that are literally impossible for the cars they are using or it goes the other way is you have some bad races or a bad lap and suddenly they are coming in at lap times that are significantly slower than reasonable. However making a \"range\" that they can perform in, and as you do well they tick closer to the top of the range is fine just dont have some random Honda Civic going 230 mph just to catch up to me.\n\nI can see the place for it and when it is done well you shouldn't even notice.

But I sent in a support email to MS to see if I could get a replacement set of CD's. Someone, somewhere within Microsoft must have been a Tex Murphy fan, because not ONLY did they send me a replacement sent of (mercifully working) CD's, but they also smuggled in an audio CD - A CD containing the soundtrack of the game. I've never been so stoked.  \nMy wife and I LOVED the Tex Murphy series - we quote his quotes on a daily basis. I have downloaded the Tex Murphy Radio Shows, and we were thrilled beyond measure when Tesla Effect was released. \n\nGood Times.

The game limits you to only a couple of the cities districts for the first act of the game, but then after a MAJOR story break the whole city opens up to you.  Enemies for the most part scale off of you so you can go where you want when you want without being level gated.\n4. Finish in three weeks?  Depends on how completionist you are.

    "Honestly, as someone who was a HUGE fan of SG-1 and someone who IS a HUGE fan of X-COM 2, the format of the game is obvious.  It's basically the same game, except instead of fighting exclusively terrestrially, you're fighting most of your missions through the stargate, though end game features should include a spaceship you can research and develop based on Gould or Asgard technology that allows you alternative means of transport to various locations.\n\nThe idea of fighting aliens and their human minions is already exactly the same as X-COM 2, and the researching through the tech trees is essentially parallels to what humans do over the course of SG-1.  Instead of building facilities in the giant avengers base ship, you could make your base inside a mountain like in SG-1. This is the best game format for Stargate.  It's that simple.  It would allow us to recreate the stories and the drama around Stargate and capture it meaningfully in a game that would have broad appeal even outside of traditional stargate fan ship.  \n\nJust don't half ass it, expand on the formula and make it more epic with more drama and more galactic politicking.  Maybe there could be a portion of the game where you're stuck on Earth and aliens are staging an invasion and you're losing, fighting terrestrial based battles, and in other parts of the game you'd be going through the gate on missions looking for new technology, or to find allies or just to explore, or maybe even to setup an alternative home planet in case Earth falls.  Give us what X-COM 2 was, except give us MORE and encase it in the Stargate IP.  You'll have a game that is universally popular and expands the Stargate brand.\n\nLike honestly, this is obvious, why has no one done this?": {

Don't see that ever happening, though.\n\n\nWithout going out the galaxy ala Universe, Stargate's run it's course now. Only way it's coming back is a reboot.

    "Source:  I worked on the MMO.  \n\nCheyenne Mountain Entertainment was developing the MMO, Stargate Worlds.  There were a LOT of bad management decisions, the least of which was starting a studio from scratch with an MMO.\n\n1.  Working exclusively from investor money with a burn rate of hundreds of thousands per month. \n2.  Standing up a publishing arm at the same time with no existing game catalog and no imminent releases\n3.  Bringing on a full customer service team before the game was even in Beta\n4.  Millions in investor money vanishing courtesy of Gary Whiting who never saw a day of jail time.  He was in the middle of an MLM scheme that tried to manipulate individuals into putting money into the CME development and promised things the scheme never delivered on.\n5.  The 2008 market crash killed investment\n6.  Forcing the developers into beta testing and promising release when the game wasn't even in a pre-alpha complete state.  Core mechanics weren't even in development.\n7.  Partial paychecks for months with the promise of catching up caused a lot of devs to leave.\n8.  Closing the other small projects way too late (Deadlands MMO, which was in prototyping)\n\nWhen the studio went under, they laid off nearly the whole team.   We had to vacate the building and were disassembling cubicles, etc.  At this point, some employees who were owed backpay were loading monitors and computers into their own cars that didn't make it to storage.  Can't say I blame them. \n\nThe few of us who remained formed a small studio called Dark Comet Games that built a small team-based shooter called Stargate Resistance,partly from assets from the MMO. Legitimately fun, the game had a decent early following in Germany, but we had zero marketing budget.  We sold a few thousand copies and shut the studio down shortly after.\n\nA class action suit hit the remnants of CME, the results of which I'm not sure of.   I provided financial details and how much back pay I was owed ($35k iirc), but nothing came of it.\n\nGame development is volatile, kids, and is just as susceptible to shitty business practices as any other industry.": {

It was a huge hit, and then Epic tried to pivot Fortnite from a multiplayer pve game into battle royale(there was a lawsuit, but it was settled since Tencent had stake in both). Pubg still did quite well but has been overshadowed by Fortnite which became mainstream and made billions.

    ">Remaster\nAn enhanced version of a game with improved visuals, audio, and sometimes minor gameplay tweaks, while preserving the original experience.\n\nWhile the \"preserving the original experience\" part would certainly be quite subjective in this case (due to an arguably different art direction), everything else applies to, for example, the Demon's Souls \"remake\", seeing as how it is mostly based on the PS3 code and its only gameplay changes are minor quality of life improvements such as omnidirectional rolling and a more convenient inventory system. Contrast that with Resident Evil 2's remake, which functions completely differently from the original game at almost every single level, and it's hard to see how those two belong in the same category. If Demon's Souls (PS5) is a remake of the original Demon's Souls, then something like Halo:CE Anniversary and Halo 2 Anniversary are as well, yet I more often hear these being referred to as \"remasters\". Something strange also occurs with The Last of Us, which has both a \"remaster\" that conserves the original presentation at higher resolutions and framerates and a \"remake\" that overhauls the presentation and nothing else, in a very similar way to Demon's Souls (PS5). \n\nI, believing any well-made game to be more than the sum of its parts, personally don't like considering a product that only changes one arbitrary part of its original (in this case, \"just\" the audiovisual presentation) a \"remake\" (I would set the bar somewhere near what Mafia: Definitive Edition did), but my point is just that the boundaries are rather fuzzy (you may as well argue that a \"remake\" of the scope of Resident Evil 2's is actually a \"reimagining\" and so on, but it just becomes a question of semantics, doesn't it?).": {

I know the itch that needs to be scratched to stay involved and focused on an mmo. Too little content and players get bored but too much, and the game gets oversaturated, and too many mechanics cause a lot of players to spin in circles, creating dead content due to best grind for gold/gear methods.\n\nAnother huge problem with mmos is the pandering to whales.
