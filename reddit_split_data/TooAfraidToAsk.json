Because Reddit is a leftist totalitarian app that only allows ideas that are either leftist or neutral. Anything remotely traditional is cutt off not because it's disrespectful or wrong but because the moderators just don't like it. Funny how this is still a \"free\" and \"open\" environment. All it took is for me to state the FACT that tomboy princess movies have all flopped except Mulan, which isn't even a recent movie, and that's because the audience that likes princesses are girly girls and trying to make a tomboy princess is the same as making a girly Spiderman. Wow, I guess the leftist moderators were already shaking by such statements to be public!",

        "comment_body": "My post was removed for being about the election even though it's a bit more deep than that, but I will post it here either way:\n\n  \nLately Twitter (X) has been coming to mind when it comes to what I would say is the breeding ground for the worst of the worst people talking when it comes to misinformation/outright lies, hate speech, vile hatred and bigotry and all things like this.\n\nFew things that come to mind are people of power with millions of followers saying things like \"ww2 was a lie\" and then you have people in the sub-tweets saying \"The good guys lost\" so now we have this idea that Germans during WW2 were the good guys, them eliminating Jews was a good thing, especially with the current narrative of how bad Israel is currently. Another instance is Tate using the hard N word slur directed at other people with no repercussion at all, which I can see people take this as it's okay to use this if they won't be punished for it, and then you have more people coming out of the shadows following in footsteps such as this. I've even seen a political figurehead (Tried to find the person but having issues) using the fa\\*\\*ot slur in a derogatory way in MULTIPLE tweets I've seen by her, and she knows she won't be held accountable for it.\n\nI know free speech is a tricky topic, but when you have freedom of speech you do not have freedom from consequences, but if you have a large enough following on a platform with an owner who doesn't punish people who should be punished, then the freedom from consequences aspect just falls through and doesn't even matter. On Twitter, there are no consequences, people are allowed to grow stronger through negative views such as this, and what makes me worried is that eventually it will grow and fester enough that actual action will start to take place. I don't even know if there's historical precedent on if things will work this way, but it seems like that would be what naturally happens when hateful ideologies are allowed to grow and multiply unchecked.\n\nOn one hand you have people advocating for certain types of free speech to be outlawed, which justifiably gets questioned because how exactly do you classify free speech? They don't trust the government to create a proper body to monitor this.  \nOn the other hand, you have people taking advantage of the aspect of free speech to push the most disgusting rhetoric through, hateful slurs, these people I don't like don't DESERVE to have rights, ALL media is fake news, Trump didn't do Jan 6 and if he did it was deserved because of the \"swamp\" infesting the government.\n\nI mean, where can we even go forward in regards to this? Whether or not free speech is regulated, it seems like America is kind of screwed. Take away even 1 level of speech and you're automatically Authoritarian, do nothing and these types of ideologies grow and get more powerful and aren't publicly shamed enough to actually make a difference and punish them properly. People like Elon Musk are legally allowed to sway elections through complete bias and having been paid to push an agenda. Is it our duty as Americans to just sit back and let this disgusting hateful nature of these types of people win? Whenever Fascism wins they did it fairly through the voting process even though it was based off of an entire foundation of lies, fearmongering, and hate speech? Is that how Democracy dies? By being forced to be complicit?\n\nI'm just wanting to know if this would be a genuine concern to have and we can expect some form of action to be taken from the level of mistrust people are having now with the US Government when people are CONSTANTLY spreading fake news online and people eat it up with no questions asked? Or does this seem like an issue that will eventually resolve itself?",

There, like this thread, the approaching elections and the recent debate between Harris and Trump are everywhere. Even in my home country (the Netherlands), it sometimes feels there is more media coverage about the US elections than our own. And both Reddit and the media, it's all about Trump vs. Harris. How are they as a person, and who won the debate. Who does Taylor Swift endorse?\n\nFor a long time, I don't understand US elections. The political theater, the mudslinging between the democrats and republicans, the focus on candidates as a person? For me, the US elections are on child-like level. The whole focus is just on two parties, but in reality on just two persons. Is this democratic?\n\nIMO The root cause isn't the candidates, but the election/political system and the (flawed) state of democracy in the US. Why isn't this the core of the debate? How is this not the center stage of attention? Especially since the events of the 6th of January.\n\nI'm afraid to mingle in these post on the elections, that I don't really understand why it is this way?\n\n1. Why do you need to register as a voter? In most other countries, you can just vote.\n\n2. Why there are basically just two parties? In most other countries, there are multiple parties with different political views you can vote for. Why do you call a two party system a democracy?\n\n3. Why is the president, both head of state and the figurehead? In most other countries, you have a prime-minister (head of state) and figurehead (president)\n\n4. Why isn't there an electoral college? In most other countries, you vote for candidates directly and the majority vote wins?\n\n5. Why does the president directly appoint judges for life? In most other countries, they are appointed for a fixed term by the governor-general or a committee.\n\nIn all of these questions, I don't mean the historical background of how the US political system came to be, but the lack of debate about reforming this system. Other countries have improved, and made their system more democratic over time, but in the US there are no real changes, or even broad debates about it.",

I don't mean to be rude at all with this question. I just want to know what your expectations are. Even though I'm also saddened to see the number of innocent lives lost in this war, and have donated to a fair number of charities to help those who are suffering, I'm not sure if there can be a reasonable end to this. I agree that Israel is currently doing most of the murdering, but this was started as a response to the Hamas attacks that happened in the month of October last year. If that's true, then why do people think there‚Äôs a good side between Israel and Palestine?\n\nRight now, statistically, 82% of Israeli Jews and 75% of Palestinians believe that the other side would never accept the existence of their independent state. Only 24% of Palestinians support a two-state solution, down from 59% in 2012, and only 35% of Israelis believe that Israel and an independent Palestine can coexist peacefully, down from 44% in 2017. Keeping this in mind, I frankly feel like the only reason Israel is doing most of the murdering is because they happened to be the more powerful out of the two. Palestine wants Israel eradicated as much as Israel wants to see Palestine eradicated.  If Palestine had the same strength of military as Israel, then they would be doing the same.\n\nMy opinion is that as of now, Palestine has a moral high-ground over Israel because of the latter's actions in the Gaza strip, and yes, I want them to stop. I really do. But historically, there‚Äôs been multiple wars, coalitions, terrorism and political influencers on this specific war that paint both sides in a pretty poor light. Palestine is not above the act taking innocent lives. It's not a squarely Israeli crime. It just so happens that Israel is doing the killing right now.\n\nOf course I want this war to end, but I don't see how that's possible. I guess the leaders of the two countries can shake hands and sing Kumbaya together, but it seems like statistically, that's not something people of either country wants. They want to see the end of the other country. With that in mind, how will there ever be an end to this conflict?",

However unlike in the past, when a losing party would alter their positions after so many losses, in the hopes of prevailing in future elections, the Republican Party has instead decided the solution is to end democracy in favor of a minority-ruled autocracy, where their will is imposed on everyone in perpetuity.\n\nThe Supreme Court features a conservative supermajority, one that by granting the President wide immunity this past month, has shown they are willing and eager to do whatever the Republican Party wishes, to accomplish this goal.\n\nIf the Republicans win the white house, and already control the Supreme Court, all it would take would be a congressional majority too (not a super majority) and the party can pretty much do whatever they want.\nThe only way to \"fix\" the Supreme Court (imposing an ethics code and removing justices guilty of corruption and/or treason, expanding the Supreme Court, imposing limits on how long a Supreme Court Justice can serve, preventing one party from denying a Supreme Court appointment during an election year etc.) is via the Democrats winning not only the presidency, but a congressional supermajority, and based on current US voting patterns, a supermajority is pretty much impossible.\n\nNo political party in US history, has ever managed to win the Presidency in more than five consecutive Presidential elections. The Dems won in 2020. Even if they win in 2024, 2028, 2032, AND 2036, they will likely lose the Presidency at least once by 2040.\n\nSince Republicans now are focused on making America an autocracy where they will always remain in power, even if Donald Trump loses in 2024, will they not succeed in this goal anyway the next time the Republican candidate wins the Presidency? Now that they know it can be done, what reason would they have to NOT attempt this, the next time they win the Presidency?",

Usually I don't give two shits about politics, just always interested in the effects.\n\nAt the end of the day, different president's don't affect me too much, and entirely too much blame is put on them that they can't control. \n\nJust wanted to get you all opinions. \n\nIf I was a betting man, I'd say rn Harris is gonna win. She's got the momentum, and even with all the locks on either side, Trump would have to take AZ, GA  and MI. I just see more paths to Harris winning. Not showing my political leaning, just a prediction. Seems like it'll come down to MI. So it'll be a tight one.",

Are you willing to show your ID, your car and your house so they can inspect and make sure that you aren't an illegal immigrant and that you're not hiding one or more?*\n\nDo they sweep a whole city, neighborhood at once? Will they frisk search everyone on the street, search everyone's homes, have roadblocks to make sure no one is missed, like really how could they possibly remove 10 million illegals without the city/country being a complete and total checkpoint? If they do it one city or whatever at the time, people could just go to a different place for the time being, because it's impossible to check the whole country at once. \n\nKey takeaway from this: are _you_ willing to show your ID on the streets and let agents into your home to show that no one there is illegal? Because how else would they ever find ALL those people?\n\nYou'll be frisk searched too, because agents can't see that you're not illegal (you're a country of immigrants from all over the world, so they'll have to check ID and can't just trust your word for it), so until you have proven that you are in fact legal, they'll be allowed to investigate you, your car and your home. They can't do an entire city at once, so you'll have to be searched and watched for a certain period of time. Limited to no travel, etc etc etc. \n\nWhat do maga people think the deportation will look like and are you willing to give up your privacy and freedom until they've 'cleared' the city/country?",

Now this one really makes me wonder. So women are upset that they will have to be held accountable if they get pregnant but then use the excuse that the reason is for being raped. Now I support that, but I do no support abortions just because they wanted to have fun and got pregnant.\n\nI've been a lifelong democrat, but the party is just silly lately and full of angry activists\n\nShe has brought nothing of value in her time in government so I really just don't get why the love for someone who was not elected by the people to be on the ticket.\n\nRemember in 2019 she dropped out of the race because no one wanted her. She was picked as the VP because Biden promised to pick a non white women for the position. So she was a DEI pick for that position.",

This can theoretically lead to the weird scenario where a person cannot vote in their own election.

In other words, the judge doesn't announce the punishment as soon as the jury finds someone guilty.  The sentence is announced at a separate court appearance, typically a few months after the defendant is found guilty.  In the meantime, Trump is out on bail.\n\n2) Under some circumstances, a punishment can be delayed until after the case has been appealed.

How many comments have you seen, basically everywhere, of people saying things along the lines of \"Save democracy, get out and VOTE!\" ? I think people have shifted left, though I do still recognise that it's going to be a close election, if the polling is anything to go by. Trump lost by a pretty big margin in 2020, the median voter might be dumb but I do think people will remember why they got rid of him.\n\nAnother dose of hopium for you: If we beat Trump next week, MAGA dies and we won't see him in the oval office again.

It's hard to predict what might happen after back to back losses.\n\n>Now that they know it can be done, what reason would they have to NOT attempt this, the next time they win the Presidency?\n\nThe biggest difference is how much Trump, and his own personal desires/wants have driven the party. We've seen staunch Republicans blanch at going as far as Trump would. A notable example would be someone like Pence on Jan 6th, or the Republicans involved in the Georgia phone call. It's not a trivial difference.\n\nTrump is also somewhat unique in other ways. He drives incredibly high turnout (both for and against) from people who don't normally vote. So far no one has replicated that, and that has implications going forward. Not clear if it's enough, given how strong polarization is, but it's worth noting. For the rank and file base, a nontrivial amount of it is personal loyalty to Trump himself.\n\nThat said, yes it will be a continuing risk going forward (and of course, a lot of damage can be done without going full autocracy. It's not an either/or). However, it's also extremely difficult to predict how the public might react. People were surprised by the backlash to Dobbs, for instance.\n\nAs a side note:\n\n>The only way to \"fix\" the Supreme Court (imposing an ethics code and removing justices guilty of corruption and/or treason, expanding the Supreme Court, imposing limits on how long a Supreme Court Justice can serve, preventing one party from denying a Supreme Court appointment during an election year etc.) is via the Democrats winning not only the presidency, but a congressional supermajority, \n\nLegally speaking, the court can be expanded via a simple majority if Dems are willing to kill the filibuster over it. Similarly for not filling a seat. They can't impeach or applying things like term limits/ethics limits without a supermajority. They seem unlikely to do this any time in the near term due to norms, but legally it is possible.",

What can he do, without the help of Congress via his office alone as POTUS, that no one else had or will have in the future?\n\nWell, the first part is, he won't have unique powers. There are two things that make Trump unique: a) his willingness to use them and b) allies willing to support him.\n\nOne example of this as you mentioned would be the recent SCOTUS ruling on immunity. That only happened because SCOTUS was willing to help him out. We've seen Congress act similarly with both impeachments.\n\n\nThere's a reason we've never had something like a Jan 6th before. It isn't because the presidency suddenly got new powers, but because Trump was willing to abuse his position, and he was enabled to do so. The same would not be true of say, a Mitt Romney (I'm intentionally picking another Republican for this comparison).\n\nThat said, as far as roadmaps go, as another comment mentioned looking at stuff like Project2025 is a good start. It is explicitly designed around consolidating power in the executive branch, and eroding various checks and balances that prevent abuse of power.\n\nAnd again, one can also just look at how Trump abused (or tried to abuse) his office previously. He's repeatedly threatened to remove people to do things like investigate nonexistent voter fraud, or his political opponents.\n\n\n>I don't see the power hungry knuckleheads in Congress giving up THEIR power to Trump ar anyone else.\n\nWell, they haven't really shown much interest in curbing him after things like Jan 6th (and we saw on video their reaction to it. It was not calm, whatever they claimed after the fact), or his abuse of office that led to his first impeachment, so hard to see how they could be so sure. They've repeatedly given up power to Trump when they've had a chance to curtail him. He now runs the party, the base is loyal to him, and they don't.\n\n\n>Someone on my FB said this and I just want to make sure I do the right research on it before saying anything\n\nIf you want a blunt honest answer, anyone posting that isn't actually looking for a response, no matter how well reasoned out it is. So you're wasting your time.\n\nBut if you must reply, a good way to start, would be to post a bit of the above. And then flip things around, and ask them what, exactly, is supposed to prevent it. People saying things like Congress wouldn't give up power often can't back it up, it's just an assumption.",

Since nobody seriously challenged Biden, about 99% of the delegates are people selected by the Biden campaign.  They aren't necessarily required to vote for Biden, but they're people who are openly loyal to him.  Party rules state that delegates are supposed to vote for someone who \"in all good conscience reflect[s] the sentiments of those who elected them.\"\n\nWith this in mind, which other Democrat seems like the replacement voters had in mind when they voted for Biden?  In his first term, Harris was Biden's VP (i.e. the person designated to replace him if necessary) and there seemed to be little doubt that Biden was going to select Harris again as his running mate for the current election.  Biden also explicitly endorsed Harris after dropping out, further emphasizing that she is seen as Biden's successor and that she would be an acceptable choice for voters who trust Biden's judgment as a leader.  In other words, Harris wasn't automatically the backup in this particular case, but she was far and away the closest person to such a role.\n\nThe party itself, along with its subdivisions from each state, was eager to get behind a single candidate, so they encouraged the delegates to choose Harris so there wouldn't have to be a big fight in the party leading up to the convention and ballot deadlines.\n\nIn short, there isn't a rule that made Harris the new presumptive nominee automatically.   The party could have selected someone else.  That being said, she was already known as Biden's potential replacement and it's doubtful that anyone else could get a party-wide consensus in such a short time frame.",

How electoral votes¬†are allocated and how elections are run is entirely up to the state legislatures. This is written into the Constitution¬†and has been legislated in court multiple times. This is why Nebraska and Maine both split their electoral votes based on who won what percentage of their state vote instead of winner take all. Additionally, few states have laws focing their college electors to abide by the popular vote or penalties if they vote differently. It is completely legal for states to allocate their votes based on the popular vote. There is an agreement being passed by multiple states where they will give their votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the state vote.

If it's a blowout, someone who might otherwise be tempted probably won't bother.\n\nThat said, there's already been attempts in the 2020 election, so it's not impossible. Luckily, most people running on it explicitly in 2022 lost their races, which hopefully will cut down on it.\n\nWhether it will be successful will also depend a lot on things like whether courts will intervene. When some places attempted to delay certifying in 2020, courts eventually intervened and forced them to do so.\n\nUltimately, it's going to come down to people in positions to do so. A lot of things would have to line up. You'd need someone in a county with the power to do so, and at least one court (probably multiple, as it gets appealed) willing to go along",

Even if voters didn't know that Harris would replace Biden at this point in the election cycle, they were aware that she was in position to replace Biden if he became unable to serve.\n\n- Each political party has a ton of polling data to get a sense of voters' preferences.

Sometimes life gives you 2 shit options, whether you want it or not. It is \"legitimate\". It's not exciting, but hey, that's life. If you have an infection in your toe and the choice is losing the toe or your foot, you still have to pick even if you don't want to lose either. If you ignore it you're losing the foot or worse. There's nothing inherently wrong with comparisons.\n\nThat out of the way:\n\nHarris can be expected to continue a lot of Biden's policies. I've liked what he's done with student loan forgiveness, the infrastructure bill, and the climate change actions in the IRA. I'd also expect her to continue the work agencies like the FTC have done on antitrust\n\nHowever, it'll take time to see how every policy irons out. For the first bit, she's going to be coming out of Biden's shadow and coming into her own. For instance, she seems to be taking a better stance on Israel/Palestine than Biden did. And before becoming VP, she had an ok record on climate change policies. She's also been consistently vocal about abortion protections.\n\n\nFor a more complete list of things done during the Biden admin, you can check lists like /r/whatbidenhasdone which has a list of things Biden has actually done. There are actual actions that have been taken. ( /r/whatbidenhasdone isn't the most unbiased list, but it's the easiest/more comprehensive one, and you can always verify particular parts you're interested in with better sources. You can probably find similar lists online). There's too many things to easily list out in a reddit post, that deserve mentioning.",

With Trump, it seems less inappropriate than usual because...\n\n- Presidential candidates are expected to share their health history.  For decades, every major presidential candidate, including Kamala Harris, has shared their medical history with the public.  Trump has not done this.  Since he has been unusually opaque about his health, it's a legitimate concern and he has opened himself up to lots of speculation.\n\n- Trump has a long history of making insulting comments that other politicians could never get away with.  I don't just mean making fun of the disabled reporter or Joe Biden's stutter.  I mean calling other people failures and losers on a daily basis.  If he's going to dish out those kinds of insults, it's hard to feel bad when he's the subject of them.\n\n- Trump himself has insulted Biden and Harris directly based on their health histories.  If Harris' hay fever is fair game, then so is Trump's health.\n\n- Trump routinely brings up his health as a reason why he's a good candidate.  He repeatedly brags about \"acing\" cognitive tests.\n\n- Politicians tend to get made fun of for things that fit into the narrative about them.  For example, Biden was made fun of for anything related to his age.  Bush was made fun of for making silly-sounding comments (known as Bushisms).  Trump's \"thing\" is his vanity and the lengths he'll go to look strong and powerful.  This includes his weird (presumably-fake) hair, orange face makeup, wearing shoes with lifts, being overly defensive about his crowd sizes, etc.  The diaper/incontinence/odor thing fits right into this stereotype.\n\n- Making fun of Trump is unambiguously punching up, not down.  He's a former president, arguably the most influential person in the US right now, extremely wealthy from birth, white, male, and is supported by multiple media organizations.  He's the quintessential example of privilege.  Joking about him is not punching down.  \n\n- Celebrities and other famous people tend to be the subject of mean-spirited jokes no matter what.  It's not like making fun of a Trump is a revolutionary thing.\n\nIn short, it's generally considered inappropriate to joke about someone's health problems, but Trump has basically done all that he can to put himself in a position where it's fair game.",

Even ignoring domestic issues, his stances on foreign issues (Russia, NATO, Israel etc) would contribute to higher risks. For instance, Trump has publicly stated that Israel should 'finish what they started'. \n\nAlso, WW3 breaking out is a pretty niche opinion right now. I don't think most people would agree that it's remotely likely.\n\n>I just hope Democrats realize that being aggressive and rude to people doesn‚Äôt too much help Harris‚Äôs campaign‚Ä¶ and they all seem to be younger people? \n\nOn social media, people probably aren't trying to optimize for the campaign/being persuasive, but giving honest reactions.

You see this happening in English too, with things like Britney vs Brittany.\n\nOn top of that, it's pretty normal for pronunciation to change for immigrants things get Anglicized/Americanized. Think of how Marie would be pronounced in by an American vs by a French person, for instance.\n\n\n>but Kamala Harris should not be teaching how her name should be spelled especially because of the fact that millions of Kamalas already exist and have their spelled the right way.\n\nI mean, it's her name. She can do what she wants with it. She's not obligated to do the same as others. Same as any other nicknames or other language shift.",

By American political rules, a lot of things like Jan 6th shouldn't have happened. It's a pretty big risk to assume the rules will hold. Two, you seem to be discounting the damage he could do in those 4 years.\n\nYou're also assuming he would be able to run again. Given his age (and to a lesser extent criminal trials that would be resolved), that's actually pretty unlikely. He's probably not going to be able to realistically run again.\n\nBut also, while Trump is somewhat unique, he's also a symptom of a broader problem. The things that propelled him to popularity aren't going to go away after his term is over. We've already seen plenty of copy cats and attempts to take the torch.\n\n> Yes it's four years of pain but it would be 4 years and done and do you want to live in an America where every 4 years we worry about him being elected again? \n\nPersonally, I'd much rather the latter, yes.",

        "comment_body": ">Why Kamala without Bringing up Trump....\n\nFirst, it's worth asking, why not? Sometimes life gives you 2 shit options, whether you want it or not. It is \"legitimate\". It's not exciting, but hey, that's life. If you have an infection in your toe and the choice is losing the toe or your foot, you still have to pick even if you don't want to lose either. If you ignore it you're losing the foot or worse. There's nothing inherently wrong with comparisons. Saying \"without bringing up Trump\" is pretty artificial, when you're going to get one or the other. That out of the way:\n\nHarris can be expected to continue a lot of Biden's policies. I've liked what he's done with student loan forgiveness, the infrastructure bill, and the climate change actions in the IRA. I'd also expect her to continue the work agencies like the FTC have done on antitrust. For instance, she seems to be taking a better stance on Israel/Palestine than Biden did. And before becoming VP, she had an ok record on climate change policies. \n\nFor a more complete list of things done during the Biden admin, you can check lists like /r/whatbidenhasdone which has a list of things Biden has actually done. There are actual actions that have been taken. ( /r/whatbidenhasdone isn't the most unbiased list, but it's the easiest/more comprehensive one, and you can always verify particular parts you're interested in with better sources. You can probably find similar lists online). There's too many things to easily list out in a reddit post, that deserve mentioning. She's also proposed a number of things during her campaign like building more housing.\n\n\n>I've been a lifelong democrat, but the party is just silly lately and full of angry activists\n\nIssues like proper taxation of the wealthy, racial inequality, and abortion have been a part of the party for a long time. This is not new.\n\n>She is anti white and supports policies to openly discriminate against straight white men\n\nShe's not anti-white.\n\n>She wants to tax unrealized gains for super rich which will crater the stock market\n\nLeaving aside the unlikelihood of this being passed, there's no particular reason to think this would crater the stock market.\n\n>She has brought nothing of value in her time in government so I really just don't get why the love for someone who was not elected by the people to be on the ticket.\n\nHer voting record while in Congress was generally fine. Broadly speaking, she's well aligned with most Dem voters. She may not be the best on particular issues compared to a say, a Bernie, but she's fine. And given the nature of Biden having to drop out, there was a need to unite around a candidate. Given the circumstances, she's a fine pick.\n\n>Remember in 2019 she dropped out of the race because no one wanted her. \n\nNo, she just wasn't people's first pick. There's a difference. And of course, 4 years of work as VP will have brought a lot of people around who didn't know her as well previously, just as it did for people like Biden/Gore. \n\n>She was picked as the VP because Biden promised to pick a non white women for the position. So she was a DEI pick for that position.\n\nEvery VP pick is made to shore up specific parts of a coalition. This is normal, and how VP picks normally go. You can see similar considerations like Pence (religious/evangelicals), Biden himself when he was picked VP, Tim Kaine, etc. The only difference is Biden saying it out loud.\n\nThat said, she is objectively qualified in the role, given her past experience.",

The questions I asked were merely rhetorical, that's why I wrote under it:\n\n\"In all of these questions, I don't mean the historical background of how the US political system came to be, but the lack of debate about reforming this system. Other countries have improved, and made their system more democratic over time, but in the US there are no real changes, or even broad debates about it.\"\n\nFor example, the two-party system. It's not how it came into existence, or that it legally or just de-facto the case (and that it's still possible to form an independent party). Why is it this way, when it's clear that this system is not working, and not very democratic, then why isn't this reformed? So that other parties get a real chance?  \n  \nI mean one of two parties is even named the \"democrats\", but the party does nothing about it. I mean I can understand that those who are in power wants to remain in power, but why is this accepted by the American people?, why are they putting signs of candidates in their garden, instead of a sign that they want a more democratic country? I think most other democratic countries would agree that the lack of choice means, that the US is a flawed democracy.  \n  \nThis last thing, that democracy in a country is flawed, can be said of course about almost any country. Take for example my own, the Netherlands. Our figurehead is a king. A very outdated concept that you get a position by birth. The discussion about this is a bit on the background of Dutch politics. Even when we have so many parties, not one big party really questions it. It's almost a bit of taboo, because as soon as you question such things you are suddenly not patriotic? Is questioning the two-party system, the same way in the US?",

This is because in order to reduce inflation, the government's Federal Reserve increases its interest rates for banks... which will in time lead to less money in the economy - which increases money's value.  \n  \nThis is how inflation is reversed (hopefully you already know this). It means there will be hardship, yes (cause the amount of money in economy is reduced, and prices have to catch up/lower AFTER they realize people aren't buying their stuff.). It's a common thing in many governments.  \n  \n(I do know Elon Musk has made tons of dumb mistakes recently in what he's said, I'm not happy about it.. but this seems true.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe rest of what you said:  \n\"They want to devalue the dollar\" - This relates to above, if there's further context needed I'd be down to discuss. \\^  \n\"Replacing it with crypto\", though... what do you mean? Stores don't accept crypto, so you'd need to convert to dollars anyway... Maybe I don't know much about crypto?  \nI DO know less printed cash (and more digital cash) is a good thing though! At least for the environment, and to cut costs, (and maybe for crime too). Would love to discuss this more.\n\n  \n\"The billionares will buy everything cheap at fire sale\", Sure, I think billionares WILL buy stuff more, but its not going to be cheap for them. There are many many billionares out there, so each will still have competition when it comes to buying stuff. This also just helps getting money out of billionares' stocks and into the economy.\n\nA quick google search of Bannon says he has left the Administration (during Trump's presidency) + Trump condemns him (possibly to save face, idk)... and Peter Thiel is not supporting either side anymore.  \nAnd finally, Trump has publicly said he doesn't agree with a lot of Project 2025, and I agree that removing the Federal Reserve seems dumb (because of the need for government to keep economy from crashing). If there's something else you wanted to mention here, please add.  \n\n\nAgain though - if you have any more information on any of these subjects, I'd love to learn.

If they reduced the size of the court, past precedent would be that it doesn't take effect until the current justices leave office (death, impeachment, or retired).

But it's an unfixable problem.\n\nAssuming one side is \"locked in\" towards escalating, the only thing you can control is how you react to it.

It's also similarly unlikely that someone would commit 4 years of college to doing so.\n\n> and use that to call themselves black?\n\nI mean, they could certainly try, as one piece of evidence. But they would probably struggle if they was obvious counter evidence that they were white.\n\nThat said, the question is not whether she is black or not. We know she is black, we know her parents. The (unsupported) claim was whether she identified with being black or not, which is a very different question for a lot of reasons. One big one being, you don't need to go to a particular college when you can just...identify as it, given she has a legitimate claim for it. Another being that doing that sort of thing would in itself be a form of publicly identifying as it. What you identify as, is defined by your actions.\n\n>If not, then why is attending an HBCU evidence of being black?\n\nYou mean besides the \"Historically black colleges and universities\" part, or the fact that it's still currently heavily majority black students? There's a pretty strong correlation there, and that's not getting into things like the sororities.\n\nIt's not an ironclad one, in theory, so if this was the only piece of evidence in the face of countervailing evidence, that might be an issue.

If we know he lies about this thing, that makes his claims about other things less trustworthy.\n\nYou can also weigh other things, like how they treat others, do they flip flop on very obvious/contradictory issues, etc. And this isn't just a candidate thing, but also can be applied to news sources.

That's about the cost of living going up. That's about having to stress and stretch limited resources. That's about a source of stress for families that is not only economic but is on a daily level something that is a heavy weight to carry.\"¬†\n\nand then goes ON to explain specifics -- \n\n>\"So we have addressed it in a number of ways. One of the issues that we know is related to this is the supply chain issue that we just discussed. So on a domestic level, in terms of domestic policy, one of the approaches we have taken is to work with labor unions and to work with municipalities in opening back up and extending the hours of our ports,\" she said.\n\n>Harris noted the administration's work to extend the operational hours of ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in California and Savannah, Georgia, to help address a backlog of container ships waiting to be offloaded amid a pandemic-induced supply chain glut that was contributing to inflation. She went on to tout the Biden-Harris administration's Build Back Better proposal as a means of¬†[~lowering costs for Americans~](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-consumer).\n\n>\"There is also a point that is important to make on the Build Back Better framework. One, it is designed to make it less expensive for working people to live. It was specifically designed to bring down the costs of child care and increase accessibility and availability. Designed to bring down the cost of elder care and make it available to all the working families that need that support and need that help,\" she said.¬†\n\n>\"And, Build Back Better is not going to cost anything ‚Äî we're paying for it. So when we can get Build Back Better passed, and we are optimistic that we will, the American people will see costs actually reduced around some of the most essential services that they need to take care of their basic responsibilities, including issues like child care and elder care, and also preschool,\" Harris said.¬†\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/flashback-kamala-harris-responds-how-shed-handle-inflation](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/flashback-kamala-harris-responds-how-shed-handle-inflation)",

He's been saying dumb shit ever since I first heard about him on the Apprentice.\n\nFor one, saying dumb shit can have an impact on things. Trump's claims about the 2020 election results have led a lot of people to not trust election results/democracy.\n\nBut two, it's not just saying shit. He's also misused his office for personal benefit.\n\n> It really sounds like fear mongering that his opponents push so people won't vote for him, I guess. \n\nIt's more so that people care about things beyond just \"Americans lives on a day-to-day basis?\". Things like abusing the pardon power or Jan 6th might not affect you on a day to day basis (or Georgia phone calls) in the short term, but that does not mean they aren't important.\n\nThat said, Trump has had plenty of effects on Americans day to day lives. As just one example, Roe v Wade being repealed has effected many lives for women looking to get abortions. There are many similar downstream examples from things like SCOTUS picks. And that's not counting for things like ACA repeal that came up just short in his previous presidency, or climate change policy, and the like. There's a quite a long list, if you want more. (This applies in reverse, as well. Many people have had their lives changed by Biden's student loan forgiveness that has managed to go through, or changes in federal drug policy, etc)\n\nTrying to narrow it down to just \"directly day to day\" is a bit of a red herring, that usually ends up just being a way to arbitrarily exclude a lot of things either because they're indirect or happen on longer time scales.\n\nedit:\n\nI forgot one other significant qualifier, as well. Many voters also care about other people. With regards to something like Dobbs, or immigration, even if someone is not affected themselves, they still care how those issues affect others.

Simply ctrl+F \"contraceptives\" won't get you all of the relevant sections:\n\nOn pg 458, it recommends rescinding the FDA's approval of mifepristone, which would effectively ban it for that use. As an interim step, it recommends restricting access to it: *The FDA is statutorily charged with guaranteeing the safety and efficacy of drugs and therefore should withdraw this drug that is proven to be dangerous to women and by definition fatally unsafe for unborn children....Reinstate earlier safety protocols for Mifeprex that were mostly eliminated in 2016 and apply these protocols to any generic version of mifepristone. A bare-minimum policy of limiting abortion pills to the pre-2016 policy of 49 days gestation, returning to the pre-2021 in-person dispensing requirement,*\n\nIt also talks about enforcing the Comstock act on page 562:\n\n*Announcing a Campaign to Enforce the Criminal Prohibitions in 18 U.S. Code ¬ß¬ß 1461 and 1462 Against Providers and Distributors of Abortion Pills That Use the Mail...Following the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in Dobbs, there is now no federal prohibition on the enforcement of this statute. The Department of Justice in the next conservative Administration should therefore announce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills.*\n\nThere's some other references in terms of a right to life which would also impact any plan-B type of birth control, which some in the pro-life crowd consider abortifacients.\n\nAnd on pg 485 it mentions reducing access to another type: \n\n*Eliminate the week-after-pill from the contraceptive mandate as a potential abortifacient. One of the emergency contraceptives covered under the HRSA preventive services guidelines is Ella (ulipristal acetate). Like its close cousin, the abortion pill mifepristone, Ella is a progesterone blocker and can prevent a recently fertilized embryo from implanting in a woman‚Äôs uterus. HRSA should eliminate this potential abortifacient from the contraceptive mandate*\n\nThere are other references towards things like emphasizing family planning, as well as allowing insurance companies to claim religious/moral exemptions to providing certain contraceptives: *HHS should rescind, if finalized, the regulation titled ‚ÄúCoverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act,‚Äù proposed jointly by HHS, Treasury, and Labor.*. Defunding Planned Parenthood would also have the effect of reducing access.\n\nWhile not a full ban for most of these (except the FDA approval, or Comstock, which would be a ban on mailing mifepristone and similar), they *would* reduce access.\n\n>On Twitter, they've explicitly said they do NOT propose banning birth control.\n\nThe question is whether those are believable. It's certainly true that it's not popular overall among the GOP, but it's also true that there is a segment of the religious/pro-life crowd who do care about the issue. And groups like Heritage have explicitly talked about it in the past. See for instance [here](https://x.com/Heritage/status/1662534135762624520?lang=en).\n\nTo say they're going to ban all contraceptives is an overstatement (in the short term, anyway), but the concern isn't coming out of left field, either.\n\n>Finally, Trump has explicitly stated he would not sign any such bill.\n\nThe problem there, of course, being that Trump says quite a lot of things, and they don't always match his actions. It's particularly concerning in this case because he's walking back [previous comments](https://apnews.com/article/trump-contraception-birth-control-abortion-2024-8f73bb1b3a5864b24157f15eb272a3e6):\n\n\n*‚ÄúDo you support any restrictions on a person‚Äôs right to contraception?‚Äù*\n\n\n*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at that and I‚Äôm going to have a policy on that very shortly,‚Äù Trump responded*\n\n\n*The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was pressed in a follow-up question if that meant he may want to support some restrictions on contraception.*\n\n\n*‚ÄúThings really do have a lot to do with the states, and some states are going to have different policy than others,‚Äù Trump responded, before repeating that he would be releasing ‚Äúa very comprehensive policy‚Äù on the issue.*\n\n\nWhich is not particularly reassuring. The mention of states in particular is an issue because of SCOTUS potentially revisiting Griswold (which was decided on the same logic as Roe), which while not creating a national ban, would open the door to state or local restrictions. He's also reduced access to contraceptives in the past, via things like Title X.\n\n\nThat all said, there are a lot of worries about Project 2025 outside of birth control. Birth control has been one of the lesser asked questions on this sub, surprisingly.",

You may just be more of a centrist. In the U.S., while most people don't agree 100% with a party, they do tend to agree heavily more with one or the other. It's rare for people to be roughly 50/50 on what they agree with.\n\nThat said, it will also depend on where you look. There are demographic differences, so online on a place like reddit will tend to lean left. Older people tend to lean right. There's also differences in things like voter turn out, electoral college etc.\n\nFor instance, as someone who is more liberal myself, I agree way more with Democrat positions on most issues. And the things I dislike about the GOP like Jan 6th are hard deal breakers (there are many others). It's a lot further than slightly edgy. Honestly, even when I do disagree with Dems, it's usually because I'd prefer them to go further left.",

There are many unfair realities stacking the deck against those at the bottom. I just can't pretend that a redistribution based on what I don't have and what someone else does have would result in anything positive at all. I would hate it and I would benefit.

You can lead a horse to water, but can't make them drink.\n\nAs far as time commitment, everyone's situation will be a bit different, so it's hard to give specific advice other than having to make the time. Speaking anecdotally, for me it started in college as well. The university happened to offer free newspapers, and I would read them over lunch/dinner, or while commuting on a bus, or the bathroom. I didn't really intentionally do it, or have to force myself. That is time that someone else might've preferred to have lunch with friends or whatever, so it's not no cost. But also, it doesn't require intense study every day, either. You can also get started later in life, if absolutely necessary. You do lose some time, but it is an option. Although, life is always busy, I think people will find there's always something else you can do. Be it a newborn child, or whatever.\n\nI don't think it takes a super long time, either. I think it sounds intimidating, but it's important to realize once you get a few sources down, you can start to springboard to use them to verify new sources. It's exponential. Ironically/unfortunately, the hardest time is the very beginning.\n\nPart of it is also just accepting that your knowledge pool will be smaller. You don't need to know the ins and outs of everything to get a rough broad picture.\n\nThat said, it's probably harder today than ever. When I went to college it was pre-2016, I think there was less political news. There were also less things like Tiktok etc vying for attention. We had cellphones, but text was still much easier on a 3G cell data plan than full video. Although a flip side of that was, there was way less places to get information or differentiate between parties as well.",

        "comment_body": "> If all of this stuff that you mentioned is so bad then why does pretty much half of the country still support Trump?\n\nJust because something is bad does not mean it cannot have popular support. Those are two different things. \n\nThat's especially true for things that are not immediately obvious. One example of this is Dobbs (The SCOTUS decision that repealed Roe v Wade). We've seen a *massive* backlash, but not until after the fact, when it started affecting people's lives. And even on this issue, voters aren't super clear. ~20% of Democrats believe Biden is responsible for it, for instance. That can't be blamed on partisanship (it's the wrong direction), it's just wrong.\n\nAs far as why, there's a lot of reasons. A big one is, a lot of people just don't follow politics that closely. The average person doesn't know who is on SCOTUS, much less most of the decisions they've made. For some things, like climate, it's easy to put off as being part of the future, or disinformation. For things like Roe/abortion, some people are genuinely pro-life and they're just fine with women not being able to get abortions. A fourth category of people that don't care about particular policies as long as they get other policies.\n\nTo give more perspective, just after Jan 6th, something like ~60% of Republicans claimed to believe that the election was stolen. Now, we don't know how many of them actually believed that, or are just saying it as a way to show support for Trump. But that's pretty bad.\n\n>Given we live in a democracy, they have just as much of a right to how this country is ran just as much as you and people who have your agenda.\n\nThe fact that they have a right to do something does not mean that it is morally right. Part of democracy is that people can vote for bad things. Democracy does what the majority wants (-ish. ignoring things like the electoral college in the U.S.). That is not synonymous with good. Part of having a right/freedom is that you have the freedom to do bad things with it.\n\n>Do you think taking away their right to vote or be involved in how this country runs is better?\n\nIf people democratically vote for bad things, there isn't an easy answer to fix that. A good (an extreme one, but still useful) historical example is something like Germany. People voted the Nazi party into power (strictly speaking, they didn't give them a full majority. But they *did* get enough power to coalition and eventually legally give Hitler war powers and eventually a dictatorship). That was bad. It did not become less bad because a large part of the country voted for it.\n\nYou can find many other examples both historically and currently. To use US history, things like slavery, Jim Crow, opposition to the Civil Rights Movement etc all had democratic support. (There's many other examples as well, such as internment camps for Japanese people in WWII). Even more recently, discrimination against gay people was widely accepted. We only got gay marriage in 2015 via a SCOTUS ruling by 1 vote. It wasn't any less bigoted then simply because it was mainstream acceptable.\n\nDemocracy is good, because it solves a lot of problems that other forms of governance have. But it is not a guarantee of good decisions. Hence the famous quote ‚Äúdemocracy is the worst form of government ‚Äì except for all the others that have been tried.‚Äù. The thing that makes democracy good is that it's as fair as we can figure out between competing interests, not that it always leads to good policies. There is nothing stopping people from getting enough democratic support to do awful things.\n\nUltimately, it depends on what you mean by \"better\". If people want to democratically do things like have bad tax policy, that's one thing (although allowing them to do it and criticizing it as bad/affecting people are two different things). If they're voting to violently oppress minorities, yes I would be ok with stepping in. There's a spectrum of disagreement, from small things, to full blown human rights.\n\nAnyway, there is a big difference between \"are there bad things happening that will affect people's lives\" vs \"should we do anything about those bad things, and what\". The former is much easier to answer.",

That is a slightly different situation- votes matter, but people can choose to vote however they want. Part of that freedom means people are free to vote for dumb things. There's nothing you can do about how people choose to use their vote, including if they choose to waste it. \n\nIf you want your vote to matter more than other people's, that's not going to happen. Including if those people choose to vote for some rich dude. Unfortunately, stuff like exposure matters *a lot*.\n\n> It has been statistically proven that the side with them most money wins over 80 percent of the time Therefore he brought the election with money.\n\nThat might be true, but there are many candidates who run explicitly on only (or mostly) small dollar donations, and are still able to win their races. AOC and Sanders are famous for this, for instance.\n\nThat also isn't getting into whether that's just a correlation (for instance, some of that is likely due to the fact that incumbents have established war chests, and newcomers don't) or anything, which is likely to be a huge skew that isn't related in the way you'd expect.\n\nAnd again, we can look at policy. If the rich could simply donate to win elections, their tax rates would be 0, or at least always being lowered, we wouldn't see laws like Dodd Frank etc. They're not.\n\nWe can also look at things like the 2020 race. ~$14 billion was spent.

It was all fun but one day she challenged him during an evening party. He literally walked into her home gym and out lifted her in the first try. In every trial, not only did he beat her comfortably, he did it while seemingly not even trying and half drunk. He also out ran her in a short sprint and destroyed her in arm wrestling.

I've only met a handful of people who could squat over 600lbs. At my peak my max was 455 and I was frequently the strongest person in any given non-powerlifter gym, that was after 7 years of consistent dedicated training. \n\nYou're just dead wrong on this. At genetic peaks there is absolutely a difference, but the strongest women in the world are as strong as the strongest man you've ever met or stronger unless you're hanging out at pro powerlifting gyms.",

    "selftext": "My dog is a service dog. Me and my prior service dogs have been attacked many times and I would like to carry a taser to defend us (legal where I am) from aggressive dogs. Often just the sound will scare off a dog, and if not, then I'm not afraid to use the taser to protect the animal that helps keep me alive and out of the hospital. I am not advocating for violence, but the aggressive pets with no task training that people are passing off as their service dogs are getting out of hand. It is becoming the most common reason to need to retire a service dog early, trauma from dog attacks. However, I don't want to end up risking traumatizing my dog when she hears it go off, so desensitization training is important. I've taken YouTube sounds as far as it can go, and now need to actually activate my taser to continue this training. Mine is not the kind with the \"strings\" you must actually touch the target with the metal prongs. What can I tase during these training sessions safely? \n\nBEFORE ANYONE ASKS:\n\nNo, pepper spray isn't a good equivalent especially indoors, even the gel kind. And it can also blow back on me and my dog. \n\nNot interested in a fire arm. \n\nThe umbrella idea doesn't work for most of the dogs in my area, I've tried it. Same with the compressed air can. \n\nNot asking for advice on alternative methods of protecting us. You have no idea what's legal where I am, what my disabilities make actually usable, etc. \n\nAnd yes, I'm aware that if the dog has already latched onto my dog it would tase my dog too. This is meant to prevent them getting to her BEFORE they bite her. \n\n",

If a dog gets ahold of your dog its eyes are even more vulnerable, and even if you and your dog catch blowback (unlikely with gel) you'll recover....and the goal is to sustain only minimal damage before running off the attackers.\n\nIf you just have a hang up with pepper spray, your next best bet is a pocket knife with as long a blade as you can legally carry so IF you have to use it the attacking dog bleeds out fast before damaging you badly.\n\nBut pepper gel would be your best move and your excuses show you haven't properly understood how dog attacks work.\n\nI wish you and your dog the best so please don't waste much time on a handheld taser.

If  I was legally blind I'd probably have interpreted more of those encounters as actual attacks.\n\nWith all that said: OP, the previous commenter is right that you run the risk of misinterpreting a situation and using a taser on a dog that doesn't deserve it. I know you aren't here looking for alternatives but I strongly suggest you spend a bit more time trying to think of some yourself. Tasers have been known to kill, and even if they don't, they are a violent way to respond to a situation.

On top of that I'm well versed in self defense for humans and I am decently versed regarding people with disabilities considering it's my career treating a range of disabilities.¬†\n\n\n\n\n¬† All that to say, reddit is not the best place to ask. If you have Facebook you should join some of the reactive dog groups and even coop care groups. No saying your dog is reactive but is reactive owners usually have a ton of great advice due to our unfortunate situations.¬† I'm sure you're well versed in it all but it's a great place to get extra support and ideas with practically zero judgement. They can be incredibly honest but you're unlikely to get the unhelpful answers dingdongs who know nothing about dog training are giving you here. I mean the fact that you even have to deal with idiots questioning you guys getting attacked is already indicative of their ignorance.¬†¬†\n\n\n\n\n¬†People who are suggesting you get a gun sound like irresponsible gun owners considering they have no idea where you live, your comfortability with a firearm, and considering you need a SD: what type of barriers might be in place to operate one. Not to mention it's obvious these people have never been bum rushed by a dog or are the types of owner who think their superior skill could easily shoot a erratic moving target without endangering their own dog or the public. I say that as someone who carries. I'm not going to shoot a fucking dog who bum rushes us, I'm going to do what I can to deter it (and if you're a responsible dog owner you're always scanning the area). If someone suggests you attempt to shoot towards it to scare it YOU ARE AN IRRESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER. All of that is basically besides the point because they aren't getting that the sound of a taser often scares the bejeezus out of a dog (again, after you've been attacked or bum rushed once you never let go of constantly scanning your surroundings) nothing will ever be a perfect defense except staying at home forever. People aren't getting that something is better than nothing especially if that something it's relatively low risk in comparison to a serious responsibility like a firearm.¬†",

The house is only what someone will pay for it at the time the owner wants to sell it. So placed on the market, the house may only get an offer of $50 million, as the top bid.\n\nSame happens with stock values. Those change virtually hour by hour. Somebody with a LOT of a particular stock starts selling a lot of it off quickly, to pay a tax bill, for instance, and the value of those stocks will in fact plummet, almost always.\n\nSo the ACTUAL worth of those billionaires is just guess work.\n\nOkay, we're at the limit of what I know enough about to comment. I am not an expert on economics or finance.\n\nI know the things I commented on are true because I have bought and sold houses and stocks.

Yes, that means no more tax deductions. Even for things like charity.

You'll have no tax benefit doing business under your name or under a corporation (liability, bankruptcy and other non-tax things aside).\n\nAgain, this is never going to happen, but I'd remove most of the corporate tax law. Depreciating assets, loans deductions... the whole big lot of it. Hopefully you set the tax rate low enough (especially on the low end) so that it is a valuable trade off. Small businesses will still form and people will still take risks as the tax rate is so low and the process is simple. \n\nThere's a few whack-a-mole areas like businesses moving money around jurisdictions.

So the idea they aren't paying their fair share is a little bit misinformed. \n\nThat being said 2 ways I can think to do it is 1, a small flat tax on an transactions, any time money is exchanges whether a loan or whatever, the government gets say a 1% interest of it (minimum 1 penny) honestly that alone would probably make the government an assload of money just taxing every monetary transaction but it would end up penalizing small transactions and benefit larger single transactions which I can see having rather big unforseen ramifications. \n\nThe other idea which is not a new idea, I am too lazy to look it up but some economist a long time back proposed a basic land tax, the rich tend to own a lot of property and I personally would increase it to a overall asset tax. However the you get the same issues with unrealized gains as values of assets will change over time however if it's a tax of the total value of all assets owned I think it could be a little bit less impactful on the economy overall. \n\nNow that being said if they just hide assets in shell companies and trusts to minimize or avoid taxes that could be an issue. My circumvention of that is abolish corporate peopleship and make corporations unable to be considered a person or sole entity but instead there must be one individual ultimately considered the owner and the one fully responsible for the corporation and entity and all assets and actions taken. I believe this is also how you address corporate crime as if the company has an individual who's solely responsible they can be held liable and punishable for all illegal actions the company does. And while they could put some smuck to be a fall guy, you are giving that fall guy complete legal control and ownership in the company. \n\nI would say the individual with the most stock or largest share would have this position and in the case of an ownership tie they would have to elect one person to be the responsible owner held liable for the organization.\n\nI would also want to hold liable individual employees and government agents (including police) removing civil protections that keep them from being liable for their actions but that's getting off topic.",

Countries that lack inheritance taxes or have huge loopholes have a lot of generationally wealthy families and maybe you don't want that.

        "comment_body": "> One of the problems is that for a billionaire much of their 'wealth' is actual a fiction. More accurately, its just an estimate. Its not as if those folks have trucks loads of cash laying around. The vast majority of their wealth is invested in something. Could be stocks, could be real property, etc.\n> \n> So you could say that Joe Money has this house worth $100 million. But that's just an estimate. The house is only what someone will pay for it at the time the owner wants to sell it. So placed on the market, the house may only get an offer of $50 million, as the top bid.\n> \n> Same happens with stock values. Those change virtually hour by hour. Somebody with a LOT of a particular stock starts selling a lot of it off quickly, to pay a tax bill, for instance, and the value of those stocks will in fact plummet, almost always.\n> \n> So the ACTUAL worth of those billionaires is just guess work.\n\nAll of this is wrong. It's not fiction, if it's fiction there wouldn't be real value in it. Billionaires don't cash out their stocks to buy their yachts, they could, but they don't not because it's 'fictional', but they get a loan from a bank instead. Again, not because it's 'fictional', it's so they can keep their stocks and continue accumulating their wealth, while they get that loan at very low interest rate, far below what their stocks are generating. A bank plays with 'real' money, and you think a bank will loan hundreds of millions or billions to somebody because their value is 'fictional'. BS.\n\nAnd your house example is a perfect example of how we do tax real estate even though it's only an estimate. Every single home owner has to pay taxes on their property. So why can't investors pay taxes on their stocks? What happens when a home owner don't have the money to pay their taxes? Well, they sell their home and downsize. Stock investors wouldn't have to 'downsize', their wealth accumulating would simply slow, and in instances where they have so much wealth in stocks that they don't actual have the liquidity to pay those taxes, they can get loans. Boohoo, what a terrible situation to be in, to have so much wealth in stocks that you have trouble paying the taxes.\n\n> So the ACTUAL worth of those billionaires is just guess work.\n\n> Okay, we're at the limit of what I know enough about to comment. I am not an expert on economics or finance.\n\n> I know the things I commented on are true because I have bought and sold houses and stocks. And know something about how business works.\n\n> I also know that in the past the very rich of various countries, when they've decided they've had enough of it and are being penalized too much ... just pick up their toys and move to some other, friendlier place. It has happened many times in the past. Again, at what point that issue can become a problem, I've no idea.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about. You are regurgitating what the wealthy have been spouting without actual analyzing whether they're true or not.\n\nPeople aren't going to take their wealth and go somewhere else. So instead of accumulating their wealth at 20% annual, they accumulate it at 15 or 10% annually. You think they're going to take their wealth out of the most trusted and reliable system in the world to go where? Where else can they make as much money as the US stock market? China? Japan? \n\nThis is the same argument they make when they say if you tax businesses more they're not going to want to make more money, because they'll need to pay more in taxes. You think a business that is making $1B a year profit is taxed at say 10%, so they would need to pay $100M in taxes, will not want to try making 1.5B a year because then they would need to pay $150M in taxes?",

Help the rich to get richer so they can create jobs for people who theoretically will make good money, and pay more taxes? \n\nThat would work great if it weren't for the fact that the reason most rich people are rich, is because they are exceptionally greedy. What ends up happening, is they create a bunch of jobs where they don't even pay people enough to be able to pay taxes, and they end up being a further drain on the government because they need government assistance programs.

        "comment_body": "I'm supposed to be doing a research paper on this very topic for graduate school. There's a concept of \"realization elasticity\" which is the measure of how sensitive the tax base is to a change in tax rate. Currently we're estimated to be at about a -0.7, which generally means that if you increase the tax rate by 100%, you actually decrease tax revenue by 70%. This decrease is due to the change in taxpayer behavior to avoid realization due to the higher rate - the dynamic effect of taxpayer behavior outweighs the static benefits of a higher fixed rate.\n\nCurrently, the \"most efficient\" tax rate is about 30%, and yet our highest tax rate is 37% for ordinary income. In order to increase rates on capital gains without reducing overall tax revenue, you have to limit the options that taxpayers have to avoid realization. Things such as getting rid of the step up in basis upon death, making charitable giving a realization event, and other possible options could accomplish this. \n\nSource: Sarin et al, (2022) ‚ÄúRethinking How We Score Capital Gains Tax Reform.‚Äù *Tax Policy and the Economy*, 36 (2022): 1-33.\n\n  \nAll of this is within the bounds of only taxing realized gains. If you want to consider taxing unrealized gains, you can increase the tax base in order to increase revenues without increasing the tax rate. However, volatility, administrative burden of valuing assets, and liquidity concerns are common barriers to having this approach seriously considered in the public discourse. Shakow (1986) recommends an accrual tax that:\n\n  \n1. taxes capital gains and losses annually at the ordinary rate\n\n2. limited exclusions (such as owner-occupied residences) would not be taxed\n\n3. some assets would only be taxed upon realization (closely held stock, collectibles), but with adjustments upon realization to account for the previous nonrealization\n\nBut the literature highly supports accrual/appreciation taxation as the most equitable, and some even suggest that it could supplement other taxes (such as corporate income tax). It seems moreso a matter of whether the public has an appetite for such an change.",

    "selftext": "Hello, straights. Question from a gay man here who just thought about this‚Ä¶ and I need answers.\n\nSo a lot of people make assumptions that every gay man is into anal sex (even other gay men!). But several of us are not; we just don‚Äôt like it and prefer oral and manual sex as our primary outlets (even stuff like thigh sex, frotting, docking). These sorts of people are often called ‚Äúsides‚Äù. (Apps like Grindr now offer a ‚Äúside‚Äù option as one‚Äôs primarily sexual position).\n\nBut does this happen in straight couplings? Do some just *not* like vaginal penetrative sex, and prefer the ‚Äúside stuff‚Äù? I mean, I‚Äôm sure it happens, but is it common? Do some couples fulfill their sex life in non-vaginal ways? Have you heard of this? Is there a biological mechanism that mostly prohibits this?\n\nIdk man, I‚Äôm just curious now.\n\nEdit for clarification:\n\nI am not asking about asexual individuals with zero sexual drive. By talking about non-anal sex between gay men, I hoped I would have made that clear. Hypothetically, a straight person not interested in vaginal penetrative intercourse could still engage in oral and manual sex.\n\nI am not talking about people in sexless relationships. Oral and manual sex *is* sex.",

For example, whenever I hear about God giving His followers hardships and trials to test them, it makes me think of all the children who were abused, molested, and abandoned. Did they deserve to be tested? What was the point in sending a monster to innocent children --- is it really to just be tested in your faith or something else?\n\nIt hurts me to think about what my family has to go through every day just to be met with a half-hearted explanation about it being part of your journey but the moment I try to ask questions they look at me like I'm horrible.

It's only through the accumulation of experiences that the idea of separation comes. During deep, dreamless sleep, this original state is re-experienced. In fact, one cannot go too long without experiencing it again, the nondual state in which no one can claim suffering. No one in history can say \"I suffered during my sleep\" (barring dreams).\n\nIt is natural for the human mind to seek out a unifying principle, because the feeling of separation is quite literally, suffering. Even in suffering, the experience of unification can be had. A connection to that seed/root provides a stabilizing force and a guiding star to not become too lost. This is why \"religion\" can help people out of very dark places. It's ideally an inward process.\n\nOrganized religion and various cultural/financial/institutional/messaging factors can distort & inbreed the core function of spiritual practice, at which point it is no longer spirituality and simply cultural or mechanical propagation.

Belief that all your suffering will be recognized and will not be for nothing, is a significant force that keeps you going. Now imagine, that someone tries to convince you, that the belief on which your drive for life has been built upon, is false. Maybe the arguments and facts given are flawless, but people will not drop their worldviews like that, especially if all their motivation in life is based on it. \n\nI think that the agrument which others make, that religion is mainly for controlling population, is rather foolish. It doesn't explain why people would cling on it for dear life, instead there is an inherent benefit to them, which motivates them to believe. Religion provides ability to persevere in hardship. You see it in many places, where significance of religion increases during hardship, and people in hardship are better able to handle stress if they have religion. \n\nOne thing where I have seen religion to be very important is addictions. There are a lot ex-addicts for whom \"belief in higher power\" was a significant part of overcoming their addiction. Its also a significant part in all those Anonymous addiction groups. The thing is, in many of those cases, people have given up on themselves, and they cease to care about what happens to them, and once that happens, its very unlikely to see yourself as fixable, but once you add a \"higher power\" then you suddenly have something that cares about you, will recognize your suffering, and reward you for it, and that is massive when you have given up on trying.\n\nAgain, I am not religious myself, and I think that there is a lot of stupid bullshit we have to put up because of some religion, but I think its important to understand why it is so compelling to others, and work from there. For me, I am rather certain that I couldn't make myself rationalize religion to believe in it, but to be honest, if I did, I think I would be more driven in life.",

You will be moving your fingers a lot, so it‚Äôs best to 100% gurantee there is nothing that can cause her pain. \nThe ‚Äúcome here‚Äù motion is integral! I didn‚Äôt believe at first until I looked at diagrams and saw repeated comments, but yes, the vagina is at a slight slant. Curl your fingers inward within her and touch the wall closer to the stomach. \nThings regarding pace can be disregarded it seems. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre wrong, but they‚Äôre partner specific. Some want fast and others slow. Take whatever pace your partner wants, whatever depth your partner wants, and always ask permission for each finger extra. \n\nThat‚Äôs all I have to say. Thank you so much for all the help we both had a great time thanks to your guidance (and dozens of vaginal diagrams). ",

You wanna rub/stimulate around it rather than just rubbing/poking the shit outta it. \n\n-Vaginas are curved and slanted, your fingers should be too. \nKeep them slightly bent rather than dead straight. Imagine you're making a \"come here\" gesture with your 2 fingers as if you were trying to touch her belly button from the inside. If you feel a surface that feels like the roof of your mouth, that's the vaginal wall. If you feel something spongey that's where the nerve endings are. \n\n-ask questions \"higher or lower\" \"faster or slower\" \"does that feel good\" \n\nMost importantly it's her body, she knows what feels good.

If she does squirt and seems self-conscious by it, reassure her that it's fine/you're turned on/etc. Whatever the case may be, just don't make her feel bad about it (obviously).\n\nOh, and make sure you've cut your nails :)\n\nGood luck, have fun, be safe, and remember ‚Äî it's about her pleasure, first and foremost. Take the time to learn the nuances of your partner's sexuality and your pleasure will grow with it.",

She was friendly to me, and I always got the feeling that she might have liked me back.\n\nIt‚Äôs been around 18 years since then, and out of curiosity, I recently looked her up on Facebook. She‚Äôs single, and honestly, she‚Äôs as amazing as I remember (if not more). I‚Äôm genuinely interested in reaching out but have no idea if it would be received well after all this time. I don‚Äôt want to come off as weird or intrusive.\n\nFor any women reading this, how would you feel if someone you knew way back then reached out? And for anyone who‚Äôs tried something similar, did it go well? Am I just being overly nostalgic, or could this be worth a shot?",

They become significant at a particular time in your life, or mark a particular memory for you. Music is especially powerful that way. We don't cry because of the loss of a relationship we didn't have, we cry because of the loss of relationship we DID have with the impact they had on us. Robin Williams, Trent Reznor, Kurt Cobain, Betty White... so many others, all have a significant place in my history and a lot of who I am comes from their influence. People express that loss differently, not for us to say what is appropriate or not. -- and also grief of a public figure creates a shared consciousness around that. Meaning the more you grieve, the more you feel a sense of belonging to others that grieve. It's actually satisfying to feed on the grief of others to generate your own grief.

Initial reports will say there was a mysterious person nearby, and that becomes a thing. Or that witnesses claim there was a second shooter. Stuff like that. \n\nWith Sandy Hook, the gun nuts became obsessed with how the parents weren't sad enough. There was a video of a dad laughing before a press conference they went nuts about. Then the racists were out there blaming the Jews, saying it was a bunch of IDF commandos or something. I'm pretty sure there was a guy walking his dog nearby who became part of the conspiracy. \n\nThen it ends up Lanza tried to wipe his digital footprint, plus he was weird as Hell. He never went out, blacked out his windows, and was only speaking to his mom via email. That lends itself to all sorts of conspiracies. At one point I believe people were claiming nobody could find a school he'd gone to as a kid, then people were claiming photos of him at school were photoshopped. Years later, there'll be a really weird video of him calling into a radio show to discuss a chimp attack, btw. And then the kids were so young it's easy to call them actors, because it's not like they have extensive employment records. There were even all these images trying to claim the kids were the same kids who'd been killed in other disasters, because kids kind of all look the same. \n\nSo you've got a crazy, unknown loner with no obvious motive who scrubbed his computer stuff, bad journalism contradicting itself all over the place (some people were saying his mom worked for the school early on, when that was wrong), and people analyzing the parents for not being sad enough. \n\nThrow in Alex Jones hyping the whole thing up and tons of Youtubers trying to be the next \"Loose Change\" and there you go.",

A faked attack could also have been staged with the CIA agitating somebody to the point of attack. That's also the thought behind many or some of the attacks. \n\nIt's really not so farfetched. Essentially it goes like this. The govt has a natural desire to opress the citizens. The 2nd amendment stands in between them being able to do that so if they could get rid of the guns then they can oppress more easily. The CIA finds disturbed people and causes the. To snap via mind manipulation, hypnosis and other methods. Eventually they snap and have access to tons of guns and they believe they are on a mission.

It also really, really hurts to use the bathroom from the back end.\n\nI'm told all these things are normal, but I feel like I was given the watered down version of what could happen and now people are just validating my experience instead of explaining.

I love this//it means a lot'. And hands down what shows appreciation is to let them see you wearing the gift, or using a gift. In the immediate moment of receiving the gift, though, take your time unwrapping, and take a minute to admire it, try it on, or read the instructions, whichever is appropriate. Don't be in a hurry to put the gift aside and resume activities, or unwrap another present if it's something like a Christmas morning. \n\n*I do realise you may have had bad family experiences that give you fears like that. I can empathise, as I had stress filled gift givings growing up where often I just seemed to not be grateful enough. \n\nI also now see it from the other side, with two now adult children, one of whom speaks in a monotone, the other tends to not know what to say and often seems dismissive because of it.

A pair of dailies with transitions and all the crazy coating in a thin high index material, a pair of basic glasses with nothing special as a back up pair and for taking photos (so I don't have the transitions on in all my photos) and a pair of clip on shades that match the backup pair so I can still wear sunglasses with them.\n\nI just wish they sold full ANSII rated safety glasses with prescription lenses.

Parents, teachers, relatives, random adults would insult or chastise kids for having poor enough eyesight to need glasses. This was often because needing glasses was assumed to have been a result of staring at the TV up close 24/7 or something. Or that you must have done something wrong to have ended up needing glasses, because even very studious people in previous generations didn‚Äôt need them. Other kids picked up on this, and would be ruthless to their glasses-wearing peers. I‚Äôve seen people laugh and joke about fellow classmates deserving death because ‚Äúwell they killed Piggy off in the book because he had glasses, why can‚Äôt we do that?‚Äù Of course, they all thought it was good fun. \n\nHaving grown up in that kind of environment, I could not understand for even a single moment why there was a double standard for vision-correcting glasses versus fashion glasses. I once asked some friends about it and got a really strange answer. They effectively said, ‚Äúbecause actually needing them means you‚Äôre inherently less-than and no one thinks it‚Äôs cool to *need* glasses, whereas people who choose to wear it for a fashion statement don‚Äôt need them and didn‚Äôt do anything wrong to deserve needing them‚Äù and it was incomprehensible to me. I tried asking further for them to clarify and got shut down with, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just gross and creepy to actually need glasses.‚Äù \n\nI don‚Äôt actually agree with any of this. I just think it isn‚Äôt out of nowhere that some might be offended at someone making a fashion statement out of glasses, especially if they grew up with others around them having views like this. \n\nIn the end, though, I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want. Glasses these days can really look amazing. I‚Äôve also worked in optical and have fitted a fair share of plano blue-blockers. I think they‚Äôre are great and can really make a person achieve a flattering look while providing some eye relief if working in front of computer screens all day.",

    "selftext": "Me and some friends and their gfs were out recently and the topic of cars came up. Specifically, we were talking about wants in men/women. I noticed among the women the generic green flags like \"should be tall, treat me with respect\" etc but one that surprised me was \"needs to have a car\".  Me and my friends all own cars but nothing too fancy, except my one friend who has a convertible. But apparently just owning a clean, well maintained car of any brand is enough and they just want a dude with a car. Idk, I never really thought of how owning a car in general is important for girls.\n\nInterestingly, even though my friends gfs admitted they don't care too much about brand, my friends convertible does get the attention of girls he passes quite a bit. However, based on our experiences, it seems the only cars that actually pop to girls are convertibles and sports bikes. The rest are just cars.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two observations?",

A lot of the time guys without cars see it as the expectation that their partner goes out of their way to lend the car/drive their partner, which is a huge burden. That was not my case at all, but it's the general idea.\n\nCurrently I live in an urban area, and although I'm not dating, I wouldn't be opposed to dating a man who didn't have a car simply because we can walk anywhere.\n\nNote: I'm not hating on the guy, he was the oldest sibling, and his dad left him so he was working his butt off to keep food on his table at home since his mom couldn't work.

I have CVI (Cerebral Vision Impairment) for me objects tend to disappear so I‚Äôve been banned from driving because I‚Äôm a threat to peoples lives if I drive. \n\nI rely on public transport and will absolutely not have anyone be my personal driver. But as a good looking guy I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences with women and men so let me summarise it for you. \n\nPeople both men and women will absolutely judge you because you don‚Äôt drive. These are the type to drop you because you‚Äôre an inconvenience to their lifestyle. They don‚Äôt care if you have a disability or fear because they‚Äôve never met someone like that before. Thankfully there is understanding people out there but they still will mostly choose lifestyle over you since there‚Äôs plenty of fish in the barrel. \n\nThere‚Äôs also those who‚Äôre girly girls and will dump you because men who have cars are more masculine and fit their ideal view of what their feminine side wants. In short they find it attractive. \n\nThere are those in the city or in areas with good public transportation so they don‚Äôt care depending on the culture/infrastructure. \n\nThere are those who‚Äôve had bad experiences with people who drive and people who don‚Äôt drive. And because both genders will have one or some bad experiences, they will paint everyone else they meet who has a car or doesn‚Äôt have a car in a VERY negative light. \n\nThis is more of a woman thing. But guys with an expensive car, newer car, or many cars are seen as financially wealthy. And if a man is financially wealthy he is more masculine and can take care of my many ‚Äúneeds‚Äù. We won‚Äôt know what those needs are as people are diverse and many. But not having a car could mean in their view you have financial problems. \n\nHaving a car for both men and women is also seen in a positive light as it‚Äôs also seen as a label of someone who is a responsible member of society. It‚Äôs also because people often tend to think about their future with their significant other. They can pick up the kids and be there at my beck and call if something goes wrong. If they don‚Äôt have the car then who‚Äôs picking up the kids and what happens if I get stranded one day? \n\nBut in summary. The majority of people will absolutely judge you based on their own convince, experiences, culture, and circumstances. \n\nThere are definitely people who are more understanding and can find work arounds if they have cars or if they don‚Äôt. \n\nBut if you think im lying about my experiences then take a look at the other comments. We‚Äôre like I said a very diverse race. Understanding yet un-accepting.\n\nThe silly thing to me is according to some, my disability makes me a bum. But that‚Äôs just how people are sometimes.

Performance for the partner, distractions, connection, sensations, self value, it all mixes together.\n\nThe first thing I‚Äôd say is learn how to be selfish in bed. At least in the orgasm and with your partner equally treated in your roll n romp, you should be able to access a relaxed, blank slate state in orgasm. It‚Äôs similar to being pee shy in a public restroom or stop using the toilet if another person suddenly is in earshot. People clam up.\n\nFocus on feeling your body, being present in the situation, focus on the things that are hot from breathing to grip to curves. You really want to get out of your head and focus on attention on how your penis feels. For me, that and learning to relax the inner muscles slightly above your taint (somewhere between where your frontal pelvis wall behind the ballsack and the g spot)\n\nOther than than, masturbation, porn, taking breaks and starting when you‚Äôre in the mood again can be great additives. Toys of all sorts help too. Taking a break from porn helps a lot too when there‚Äôs less to compare to in your head.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre young tho, make use of your stamina but take lots of breaks and be ok with not finishing sometimes. You can always masturbate later - sex is better when connection and mutual pleasure are the focus not just the finish line.",

Don't vary your speed but try to go as quickly as you can. Generally when we jerk off it's a lot faster than we can thrust so going quickly can mimic this. \n\nPossibly hold off all sexual anything for a few days, till you feel like you're gonna go crazy if you don't get some, no porn, no jerking off, it'll probably only take a few days but you'll almost be itching to feel stimulation. It'll feel a lot better.\n\nAlso if there are certain kinks or fantasies you have you guys can try them as those make you cum faster. \n\nFinally you might be going through a bit of a biological phase. I know some guys when they quit porn feel a period of lost libido or difficulty in bed getting it up or finishing which can be due to a large drop in dopamine and a mild depression due to a long term decrease of the usual levels of dopamine one is used to. So if you're on a diet or depriving yourself of something which you may have been addicted to than this might cause a short term issue like this and continued abstinence will after some time bring back your libido and such. \n\nHope this helps",

Even its etymology was clearly based on NW-Indian identities. It's Panjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan.. East Pakistan got genocided the first try they got, leading to the 1971 independence war of Bangladesh.\n\nIn India, you have Lucknowi muslims, Bihari muslims, Konkani muslims and Hyderabadi muslims. (and many more). To all of them, their lingustic and regional identity came first. A Tamil muslim would rather shoot themselves than learn hindi/urdu. Given a choice between coconuts & Islam, a Konkani muslim would pick coconuts. These identities go back 1000s of years. They precede islam, christianity & modern variants of sanatana dharma. Therefore, they take precedence.\n\nThe explicit arab-ization of Indian muslims didn't occur until the Saudis turned wahhabi mosque funding up to an 11. Ironically, the Saudis have done an about-turn and become liberal, but the decades of conservative-wahhabi funding have destroyed natively-compatible variants of Islam in many countries across Asia. Go back to 1950s, and Indian muslims were aesthetically indecipherable from their hindu neighbors.\n\nLast but not the least. Despite what social media narratives may say, Hindus are exceptionally accommodating as a majority. Afterall, if a majority is sufficiently oppressive, there will be a mass exodus or a war. In India, Muslims get special rights (affirmative action), special control on funding of institutions (mosques, madrasas, etc) and special laws (islamic civil code). Compared to every other religious majority in the 3rd world, Indian Hindus have a stellar report card on minority treatment.",

You'll basically live in hiding, be harassed or bullied, sometimes people can even commit crimes against you without retaliation... Heck, even deviant Muslim minorities often find it hard to exist there. So if you're Hindu in Pakistan and chose to stay after partition, your life is progressively getting worse and worse, you're just going to pack up your things and move to India.\n\nIf you're Muslim in India, maybe you are in a Hindu dominated city/province that makes life hard for you.

It's one of the few well-moderated subreddits and has quite good quality control. The summary is that the movement for Pakistan was mostly led by elite North Indian Muslims who feared that their interests and power would be eroded in an independent, majority-Hindu India. Pakistan was carved only out of the northwestern regions of British India and East Bengal, but Muslims resided and continue to reside elsewhere in the country.\n\nAlso remember that the ensuing state of Pakistan was so dominated by those Urdu-speaking elite Muslims, that East Pakistan, whose population was culturally and linguistically very different, were heavily prejudiced against and East Pakistan eventually split to form Bangladesh.\n\n>In response to this growing clout of the Hindu middle class (especially professionals), the Muslim elites of North India, comprising of landlords principally, formed the All India Muslim League. The aim of the League was simple: protect the interests of the elite Muslims. It did not at all want anything to do with poorer Muslims like Pasmandas. So, in pursuance of this, a lot of solutions were proposed. When it became clear that the British was going to leave India, League‚Äôs proposal was a confederated state that would divide India into Muslim majority areas, Hindu majority areas, and areas where neither had a clear majority. Of course, the Indian National Congress was completely opposed to this. Eventually, the solution came to be that Muslim majority areas in the northwest and northeast will be cleaved to form a new state, which is what ended up being Pakistan.  \nYou will notice how North Indian the Pakistan project was. It was led by an elite group of landholding Muslims from the northern region of British India. However, even they did not know what the project was. In fact, Jinnah didn‚Äôt imagine a significant population transfer as it happened when the Partition occurred. He is on record appealing to Muslims to stay wherever they are. In other words, he didn‚Äôt really want Muslims from other parts of India to go to Pakistan. This also meant that he wanted Hindus in Pakistan to stay put. In reality, a lot of people ended up going to Pakistan, a similar number came to India; but it was heavily a North Indian affair. Very few people migrated to Pakistan from south India. This is because culturally, Pakistan is completely alien to South Indian Muslims.  \nSo that is how a lot of Muslims ended up not going to Pakistan, or, as I would prefer to put it, staying put in India. It‚Äôs a combination of logistics, lack of understanding what Pakistan was, geographical limitations, and simply not wanting to be part of it. Some were by accident part of Pakistan or India. In no case did all of British India‚Äôs Muslim population form a monolith or demand Pakistan in unison: they simply didn‚Äôt even know what Pakistan was for that.",

I worked 30 hours a week and went to school for 5 years.\n\nMy wife did the same.\n\nWe‚Äôre both 25 now and things are looking really good for us. Here‚Äôs a rundown:\n\nI have $40,000 in 401k (wife is on a pension)\n\nWe have $145,000 liquid in a 5% interest account. We plan on buying a home in 2025. I might move this to all S&P 500 if rates keep going down, idk yet.\n\nI have $12k in car debt (it‚Äôs at 3.8% interest. it‚Äôs low interest not really dying to pay it off.) \n\nWife has $9k in student loan debt that‚Äôs been deferred. \n\nWe make $9,200 post taxes and retirement monthly. With interest it‚Äôs like $9600.\n\nLast year we had $110,000 saved. So we saved $35,000 in a year and we also paid $10,000 for my wife‚Äôs grad school (she‚Äôs done now). So we really saved almost $50k.\n\nThis is with us going to Disneyland and going on a trip to Europe this year.\n\nEssentially what I‚Äôm asking is that we‚Äôre doing good right? I‚Äôm worried because our lease is expiring ($1800 a month) and my wife wants to rent a nicer place at around $2200 a month and all I remember is the years I was dirt poor counting every dollar. I‚Äôm still inclined to rent for cheap.\n\nWe can afford to rent a really nice place right? I‚Äôm worried about lifestyle inflation. Idk.\n\nI‚Äôm addicted to saving money and let me tell you I worry whenever I buy anything for myself. If it was up to me and not my wife we‚Äôd be living in a shithole and no vacations, lol. ",

Hell you're doing amazing by many people's standards.¬†\n\n\nI will say, maybe it's time to seriously look at the house sooner rather than later. My rent was $1200 in 2016, it was going to be $1350 when we decided to end it. We found a house, it's $1300ish a month. Basically the same as our rent except we get equity now. And you know what? When COVID hit that apartment we left raised prices to $1700. Our payments are fixed interest and stayed the same.¬†\n\n\nWe also have a backyard for our dogs and about double or triple the space.\n\n\nNow there are downsides to owning. But if you're looking to own in the future than the sooner the better tbh.¬†\n\n\nLife style creep is real and it can get really problematic if you let it. I think what worked for us is to keep a good eye on it. Numbers should always be going up. Also we made a few extra accounts. The interest is terrible but it's nice to have money \"physically\" set aside for retirement and large purchases we budget for. I'm very much like you. It's physically hard for me to buy anything over like $80 lol. But you don't have to live like you're scrapping by anymore either (although who doesn't like the occasional Ramen?

There's nothing I can do, and the phone company can't block him. My niece lives with us, but she pays her own phone bill and it's her phone under our plan... Changing the plan does nothing as her other aunt will simply supply a new phone or her mother will. Idk what to do.. and all the advice I ever gave falls on deaf ears but is an entirely new idea when someone else says it... \n\nThis boy is a controlling gaslighting narcissist, and she has been wrapped around his finger for over a year and a half or more. We pointed out the red flags, and the only reason they broke up was because someone else at her work went through it with someone like that and she told her how it was.... Otherwise they'd still be together but she keeps the life vest in the water for him and wants to be friends with a guy like that wished her dead and told her multiple times to kill herself. Idk what to do.\n\n I just listen, I can't say anything.Now she complains how he owes her $400, and that she sent up like up to $1000 over the time they were dating.. and she was 15-16 years old at that time. this boy is 20 btw. We told her at the time we found out she was sending him money that it was a bad idea... Still fell on deaf ears. I guess she just has to be one of those people that learns everything the hard way. Just keeping my ears open all I can do I suppose. But most importantly... The only thing I'm at loss of is the harassment which she doesn't see as harassment.

Its simply not worth it, compared to dealing with day to day stuff. For example in Spain teeechnically the male heir has priority over the female heir no matter the age, which is clearly sexist, but oh well theres only two princesses sooo... lets just leave that problem for the future. Obviously, if the second born had happened to be a boy, that wouldve been changed, but as it stands, why bother? Think about how convoluted politics are in your own country, and what it would mean to fundamentally change the state. What the monarch does is written in the constution, even if what they do is essentially \"stand there, be pretty and be our yes man.\"\n\nPlus, it makes for day to day drible and stories about the royal family gets the media going, and its a bigger part of how countries and diplomacy interact than you would think. The stories about two royals from two european countries meeting each other puts out a feeling of \"friendly get together\" vs two prime ministers, which would instanly be a political session (both are) and could make a meeting be a way bigger deal than what it actually is. And its an easy target, give people a prime minister and they¬¥re gonna want their head at any problem, give the people royalty and oh well its not like we can kick \\*them\\* out\n\nAlso, in many ways, and in this i can only speak for spain, theyre not beloved as in adored, but people arent bothered by the royal family, they put out sensible speeches, do the whole theathre of caring for the people and are there basically to be a celebrity but with invitations to other types of parties. Overall, since they cant do much, its not like we have a reason to hate them (still want them out tho, just... in the future)",

The crown is also a legal entity for the purpose of court cases, criminal prosecution, land ownership etc.  \n\nWhile his role can be seen as largely ceremonial, he does take an active role, meeting with the prime minister at least weekly, where the monarch has a duty to \"encourage, advise and warn\" the prime minister on matters of policy. You can think of the monarch is an overseer, a watchdog, a wise adviser. While the King technically has the power to not give assent to laws, dissolve parliment and dismiss ministers, in practice this doesn't happen, at least not without the consent of parliament. This upholds the constitutional nature of the monarchy.\n\nIn addition to this role in the United Kingdom, the King also performs most of the same functions for 14 other commonwealth realms (including Canada where I live) acting through a vice-regal position of an appointed Governor General, who performs all the tasks of the King in his absence.\n\nSo it's not as if they do \"nothing\".

We used to have a mechanism in the electoral college that would allow for a degree of separation between voters and the actual election of the head of government, through \"unfaithful electors\".

This can easy fly all around in short periods of time as leaders change. A monarchy is intended to show the permanence of a nation's ideals.\n\nDuring trump and W, we lacked a king/queen to say things like \"we still support nato, free expression, nuclear non-proliferation, etc...\"\n\nWe did **not** have that, and as a result, many allies have (reasonable) doubts about whether we honor our treaties, and many of our enemies now believe they will never need to fight America with tanks and planes. Instead, America can simply be bought out.\n\nI am not arguing about whether a monarch is worth the price tag. But to argue one has no value at all, seems unreasonable.

Charles probably won't be in the job long, but QE2 was there long enough to become the most famous person in the world. Everywhere she went, crowds had to be managed, roads were closed etc. The only politician who gets that level of fame is the US president, and that's only for 8 years max. The value of the PR this generates is immeasurable, as well as the PR generated when hundreds of millions of people are watching the sights of London whenever there's a royal wedding, or a new baby, or a funeral - the while world knows what Buckingham Palace looks like.\n\nOn a political level, the presence of a monarchy separates the nation from the unpopular politicians who govern it, which prevents the nation being stained by unpopular political choices while reducing the influence of demagogues - there are no Trumps and Putins in European monarchies. A good example of this was the end of the war - the public gathered to celebrate outside the palace with the royal family while Churchill was unceremoniously booted from office.",

So publicly they would just keep denying/downplaying that anyone was seeing anything. The people insisting they had seen evidence of impossibly advanced aircraft and the government was covering it up were actually right- Just, the coverup wasn't to conceal evidence of aliens from the public, just to conceal our military capabilities from the soviets.",

    "selftext": "I'm Australian so my exposure to the Big Four and the Premier League are very limited. I have my teams for AFL, NBA and NFL as there the three sports I support and have some sort of personal connection with. However, I've recently started getting into the Premier League and the MLB. I'm honestly wondering how people choose teams to support. I follow Dallas in the NBA as my cousin played for them and consequently just followed the Cowboys whilst we were over there visiting so it just made sense. But I have no affiliation with Dallas for other sports as I haven't been interested in them in the past. I've heard of American's following four teams from four different states for the Big Four sports and have wondered why not go for all four teams in your city? (if you have them). Don't want to seem like I'm jumping on a winning bandwagon with a team. How did you genuinely come to support your teams and are they all from the same general area or are they spread out. Same goes for Premier League, how do you pick a team to support knowing there's so many different tiers from promotion and relegation. You can go with a safe team who probably won't be relegated or do you just pick a team you like and hope for the best to stay in the Premier League or one day make it.",

It's been that way since I was a kid.  I have to sleep in a completely dark room, that is silent.  Even white noise can bother me.  I have always had sleep issues.  My husband and I sleep in separate rooms because of this unfortunately.  Some people are sensitive sleepers.  My husband on the other hand could sleep through a tornado.  \n\nIt would be good for your own health to find out why you're snoring.  It could be as simple as allergies or it could be more.

My voice becomes soft/whiney/high pitched and I mix up words & pronunciation, went from time to time to near constantly. I notice he talks to me *way* different than other people, like when he's talking to his friends his tone will be more \"his\" than when talking to me he'll try to be more like mine. I can't be trusted to cook, drive, or work for safety reasons. I need assistance showering. He never seemed bothered. If anything, he seemed kinda joyous from helping. I wasn't always this bad, since with him I went from not having a driver's license (didn't get it till my 20s) -> able to drive -> completely unable to drive. I remember asking him how he's not bothered by my flaws since the early days of us being together. Was it some sort of fetish? Kink? Something? He would just say \"I like feeling helpful/needed\" and now it's been 6 or so years, and I asked him again. He seemed to have gotten so used to it he hasn't even noticed. He just said along the lines of that he'd be there for anything. And I do sorta have two sides, depending if I'm on \"substances\" I'll feel a lot more clear headed and independent. He loves that side too. I think it's at the point of independence or not he'd love both sides.\n\nSo, I think it comes from wanting to feel needed. Someone who \"acts childish\" would have a lot more needs than someone more independent, leading to feeling \"less needed\".",

Any part of the world where you see \"fierce\" as a complement... \n\nThose guys get hot over a wicked smart lady, someone who could help them fix a car, a woman who can run her own company, etc. Because they value having a power couple more than feeling \"bigger\" than her (power or size).\n\nSo honestly, it's going to depend on the dude... and his examples of beauty during his formative years.

Being like that all the time is exhausting for everyone around and as a grown person you need to have some emotional regulation skills, but letting yourself go like that in a safe space can be freeing and interpreted as trust as well.. My ex liked it about me because he was on the spectrum and me having a very expressive face made it easy for him to know what's going on. It needs a specific type of person to like that. Also, the way it's shown in those videos is cringy over the top. But most things online are made more extreme to appeal and make it obvious.

I don't really talk to one of them any more but I'm still friends with the other and nothing has ever been weird. We both moved on. I don't have negative feelings towards either of them. \n\nI'm so obsessed with my girlfriend dude, she's the sweetest ever and every day I cherish her. I could go on and on about chessy corny stuff but at the end of the day I want her to feel like the luckiest lady alive. I care about her so much. The idea of missing an ex is so fuckin wack to me. If you miss your ex and moved onto another relationship then you're an immature asshole who's bringing down someone else and that's exactly what your \"boyfriend\" is doing to you. You deserve better. You deserve to be cherish and loved, you deserve to be able to trust that you're the only girl he misses and thinks about. I always miss my girlfriend, even if I'm gone for an hour or two. I think about her so often. \n\nShe's also has a fair few exes and that's something she thinks about and laughs at because all but one of them were fucked up and terrible to her. The one that's chill I was great friends with at the time and we still talk from time to time. It's all just handling things well and being mature, communicating and most importantly honesty. \n\nIt's okay to be sad about a past relationship not working, its okay to miss an ex, but to rebound and drag some poor soul along with you is terrible. Someone who can't move on isn't deserving of a relationship. You deserve better. He should be worshipping the ground you walk upon, he shouldn't be spending all his time thinking about his ex when he has you right there.",

That guy is out there somewhere. \n\nJust know you have worth, you are deserving of love and care, I know it's cheesy but everyone is beautiful, I'm not sure how you feel about yourself but just know you are beautiful for not only the stereotypical reasons but also just the logical mathematics that every single person is the most attractive person to someone out there, and when those two people meet its like magic. \n\nYou'll find someone, someone who'll feel incredibly lucky to have you. Try your best to be optimistic. I used to be incredibly pessimistic and negative towards myself, I still struggle to be positive but I can try my best to remain honest with myself. When you think negatively just try your best, even if it feels really silly and corny and maybe dumb, just tell yourself something positive. Most people are always comparing themselves to others, and don't realise that others compare themselves to you. Try to look at yourself as if you were someone else.

Because if they both were then it would have been a consideration from the beginning. And if one partner wants it and the other doesn‚Äôt, the one who doesn‚Äôt is never going to be happy with the arrangement (or the knowledge that they cannot fulfil all their partner‚Äôs needs by themself).

Onion BO gets super strong when I get stressed, is this your case?

I use nivea black&white antiperspirant as rollon deodorant. And that's it.\n\nAs for the sweating, you're 13, your body is developing, hormones are a bitch, and there is nothing you can healthily do to avoid that. Please go see a doctor for the sweating. I also had (not anymore) that problem, it went away by itself by the time I turned 20. Sounds desperating, I know. But, trust me, it's unlikely other people can smell you. In the meantime you can carry a small towel or baby wipes to dry yourself and be more comfortable.\n\nAlso remember that if you overwash yourself, it can cause skin issues.

It can make you feel exhausted and hopeless. Men have to go through this on average about 10 times before they get someone who just is willing to engage, not even someone who will end up with a relationship or sex or even a date.\n\nNot only does the rejection hurt because of how it makes you feel about yourself, but you also feel like you're harassing or inconveniencing women because of your approach. Not a day goes by that I don't hear women complain about being approached. We know it can be inconvenient and we don't want to be, but it's not like women carve out an hour of their day to be available. It's always inconvenient if you aren't interested in the guy, and that's 90% of the time.\n\nPaying takes all this off the table. You know she's getting something out of it, so you don't feel like you're inconveniencing her. You know she's not likely to reject you, so you can let down your guard and feel like a human being again.\n\nIB4 someone calls me an incel, I am happily engaged to the kindest, most beautiful woman I have ever met.",

Basically he says he makes her orgasm via cunnilingus (and fingers). But then he puts it in - right after her orgasm - and starts ramming it hard, aiming for multiple orgasms. He claims she enjoys it a lot and manages to score a second orgasm this way. But how does this not hurt like hell?? (Ladies, what do you think?)\n\nNow I know this guy, he's a bit of a show-off in general so that's why I think he's bs-ing, but maybe he's not. Also I know that the clit is sensitive after an orgasm, just like my penis is really sensitive after an orgasm. So I imagine the girl needs a bit of time before he starts ramming it in like that.\n\nNow another friend of mine didn't even believe that he's making her cum from the pussy licking and assumed she's faking the orgasm. But this part I believe, because my gf can come from cunnilingus too, plus his gf is a juicer so definitely the orgasm is real. But the ramming right after the orgasm, what the hell?... He says he rams hard because he's so excited of her orgasm and juice and he's so rock hard and he comes inside her in like 10 seconds. So I'm thinking maybe she puts up with the pain because it'll only last seconds and she already came, so it's not that bad.\n\nI'm just curious if girls could see this as something realistic to get multiple orgasms.

You have to explore and familiarize yourself with every body individually -- and hey, if there are women who orgasm from nipple stimulation, some can only get one with one of their toes in your mouth, another one has to be thoroughly rimmed before she can orgasm properly -- then there definitely are women who can orgasm twice in the method hitherto described by yourself. \n\nTotally valid. Anything is totally valid. \n\nOne of my relatives, who is 40-something, claims she only really orgasmed when her ex-husband would wear his police outfit hat. She claims it was the thing to really get her going. (P.S. haven't cheked this one, she might be bs-ing tho)\n\nSo, to each their own.",

They are happy with YTTV, and are happy saving $135/mo.\n\nI'm over 50, and happily pay under $30/mo for streaming subscriptions, which obviously don't include any of the big streamers like YTTV, Hulu Live, Fubo, Sling, etc.  I haven't had cable TV since the mid-2010s.",

I'm 58, and I pretty much see anybody who's between 20 and 60 as a peer.  I don't feel out of place when I'm at some coffeehouse where I'm 20 to 30 years older than everybody else in the place.  When I was in my 20s, many 50-something people grew up in an era before rock, when the top 40 charts were dominated by crooners, trios, and big bands.  They were practically from a different *country*, where everything was in black and white, production music played constantly in the background, and every sentence began with \"Saaaaaay\".  Sure, we Xers think broccoli hair looks stupid, and wonder why you Generation Zers are so obsessed with gender identity.  The way I see it, though, the generation gap between X and Z is more like a crack in the sidewalk, compared to the canyon between us and our Silent Generation parents.  \n\nA few years past the early 60s, where you start to encounter a lot of men who are obsessed with golf and women whose wardrobe consists largely of flowery prints?

People on the internet might cheer when a nazi gets beaten up badly in a video even if that nazi, at that moment, wasn't violent. Or some guy yells at a woman and another guy smacks him down and kicks his ass. And that's understandable. It's only human to find satisfaction when someone gets their deserved comeuppance.\n\nI don't think that's a good model for how to behave in a society, though. There's a reason why in Western countries, violence is usually reserved for the state. Having a court of law settle a dispute and the police and state enforce it is how things hould work.\n\nThere is a problem, however, when the population doesn't perceive the state to deal out punishment or violence justly. If having money, or being white makes it more likely you get away with crimes, and being poor or black makes it more likely to become a victim of violence by the state, then that social contract is broken and some people might come to the conclusion that it's only fair for people to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis is a bad solution, however. We should work to fix institutions like the justice system and police, but the general idea that in a democracy the state has a monopoly on legal violence is a good one. That only works if the population at large trusts the state to use that monopoly wisely, however. At the moment, that isn't the case in many societies.",
