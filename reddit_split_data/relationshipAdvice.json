Each time the girl has messaged him being flirty. Before I never had an issue with this but after the amount of comments he has dropped on posts it raised a red flag. Is it okay to feel the way I do ? ",

    "selftext": "Good evening. I have been in a long-distance relationship for 4 months. My girl in the last couple of days started replying to my messages very briefly and not actively participating in the conversation. She has done this twice in the past few months, and the first time I stopped talking, she texted me after two days saying I wasn't interested, and that's why I paused talking. I told her that since I saw that she was not in the mood, I stopped texting until she found it. The second time she did it, I texted after two days asking what she was doing, and he answered me very earnestly. Now, she has been talking for 2 days in a cold way, so in her last message she replied like that; I didn't send a reply. I don't want to look desperate. My girlfriend and I meet once a month, and when we are together, we have a great time both sexually and getting along with each other. I am thinking of not texting back and let her check in whenever (and IF) she wants.\n\ntl;dr My GF responds in a cold way the last two days, I stopped replying and I dont know if I have to check inafter 1-2 days or wait for her to do it.",

I don't know if that's a factor or not in his behavior.\n\nMy partner enjoys video games quite a lot, and spends hours at a time playing them. Both while I'm away, and while I'm at his home. He has told me that my presence (Me being nearby, while he is on his computer) is comforting and calming, but doesn't like to/struggles to focus on activities with me. There was an instance that he spent 6-7 hours on his computer after promising to spend a nice afternoon with me a long time ago. He hardly remembers this instance, while I remember it like it was yesterday, due to the sadness it brought me. He did apologize after.\n\nWe were just having a conversation about a few things, and he related the guilt of not doing his homework(while on his computer), to the guilt of not doing something with me(while on his computer). I find it strange that I, his girlfriend, which he has said he would like to propose to at some point, am compared to the same burden of homework.\n\nIs this an ADHD thing? Or am I that unimportant to him?\n\nEDIT: this is my first real relationship, so i don't know if all men act this way. please help me understand.",

I block out time on my calendar to take her to the park. I bring a brush with me on a walk so we can sit on a bench while I groom her. I play quick games where I hide a treat and tell her to find it by scent. \n\nYour boyfriend needs to figure out how to BE a boyfriend if he wants to be in a relationship.

Not to mention the day of our anniversary, while I’m laying in bed that morning, he spent over a $100 on content while I’m willing and available right in front of him.  \n\nNot to mention the fact that my sex drive is through the roof…. I’m a very physically loving person and I can’t help but get down on myself because he’s not in the mood 3/4th of the time and it also doesn’t help I’m a plus size woman and all of the woman he is subscribed to and purchases content from are thin….\n\nFast forward to yesterday, he’s been hinting at the idea of purposing lately and even mentioning things like don’t look through the conversation of your dad and I. Well once again curiosity got the better of me and I snooped…. Well I can say that there’s nothing in the conversation between my dad and him…..but I did see a new subscription in his Apple account to a AI generator for nudes that lets you take a normal picture of someone and turn it into a nude…. No big deal or so I thought till I saw in his hidden folder that he generated a photo of his BEST FRIEND/BROTHER’S EX FIANCÉ!!! \n\nI don’t know how to go about bringing everything up but with my hormones and mental health I CANNOT hold it in or I will go crazy. \n\nPlease help 🥺😕😔",

    "selftext": "\nMy girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for a little over 2 years. We have had our issues but I never felt as lonely as I have been feeling this past year. She lives in another city but the travel takes only 1 hour and 30 minutes, so we meet 1-2 a week. \nI am a college student and she works part time.\n\nWe used to call a lot and watch movies/shows online maybe once or twice a week. We would also TALK. Just talk, share things. Discuss things.\nI am someone who needs to talk to feel connected. Some people feel connected through other things like sex but i need to talk and this was never an issue until last year November.\nShe would just stop talking to me completely for weeks on end and just play video games and act like it‘s completely normal. We would call and she would not say a word to me. We would text and she would respond 4-5 hours later.\n\nThis stopped for a while and it started again in April this year. It‘s awful. I have been crying almost every night since because i feel so insecure.\nI tried to communicate how lonely this makes me feel because whenever i do share something, i only get a very disinterested response back.\n\nWhen she wants to talk, which happens like maybe once a month, i‘ll make sure to engage because i want her to feel heard but she never does the same for me.\nWhen we meet, we have sex and she sleeps and then everything is fine and i am starting to feel like she doesn‘t love me anymore and just wants me for sex.\n\nThe reason i am still here is because sometimes she will give me attention and it just feels very good but then it‘s like 3 weeks of nothing. \n\nWhen we do go outside, which we NEVER do, i want to use the opportunity to talk to her and connect to her but she is listening to loud music in one ear, which makes me feel like she doesn‘t really want me to talk, so i don‘t. \n\nShe told me that it‘s because of work and how she is so tired but she works 3 days and has 6 days off. She talks to other people but not to me.\nI am not someone who is needy or clingy but i‘ve been feeling very lost and insecure.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone? \n",

    "title": "I think my bf is an alcoholic ",
    "selftext": "I’ve (23) been dating this guy (28) for over 3 months now. I work in finance and he is a bartender. He had been drinking frequently but we had a conversation about it because I don’t want to be with someone long term that drinks every single day. He cut back a lot which I was thrilled about. \n\nFlash forward to a couple weeks later and we are celebrating his birthday the day before his actual birthday (I was celebrating a friend’s birthday the day of). We got a nice dinner and drinks. At the last stop of the night we were talking about how he had cut back on drinking and how good it was. I told him he should keep it up and he said that he wasn’t going to not drink but he would try to tone it down. He had invited me to stay over after my friend’s birthday dinner the day after so he could see me on his birthday. I told him I’d love that but no pressure because I work early the next day and if he’d rather just have a late night with his friends then that’s fine with me. He said no, he was going to dinner with his family and then a beer with his buddy and he’d be back by 10. I offered to pick him up the next day on the way to his house. We had had conversations prior about how I am against drunk driving so I said that if he was going to get drunk, then I’d come get him but he said he was fine. \n\nThe next day rolls around and I have a great birthday celebration with my friend. He tells me to text him when I’m leaving so he can meet me at his house. I told him and he said “perfect, I’ll head out after this beer.” I said okay I’ll be there in 30. He told me the key was in the mailbox. I then offered to pick him up and he said again, “no, I’m going to leave after this beer.” I responded a bit later and said I was 20 minutes away and he said, “great, I’ll head out soon.” I finally get to his house, expecting him to be there and he’s not. I text him that I’ve arrived and he said, “okay I’m coming.” I said okay I let myself in see you soon. A little bit later he said, “okay I’m leaving the bar” to which I responded “you’re joking.” Finally he said, “okay I’m actually leaving” and I just sent back the SpongeBob meme, “one hour later.”\n\nHe gets home and he’s super drunk and drove himself home. He said, “sorry I’m late it’s my birthday” and I just said, “it’s okay just communicate better next time” and he said, “it’s my birthday.” I was annoyed and started processing the situation. He was being incredibly unattractive and sloppy drunk. I asked about his night and he rattled off all the places he went and the drinks he had at each place which totaled 25-30 drinks. He said that it was a casual night for him. We had some other unattractive conversations and then the next day I left feeling incredibly disrespected not only for my time not being respected but the fact that he knows how much I am anti-drunk driving and specifically asked him not to do it and even offered him a ride multiple times. \n\nWe ended up talking on the phone a couple days later because he could tell I was being cold. I stated my case and explained why I was upset. I said that I should not be telling a guy 5 years older than me how to make a good decision. It was Halloween night so a night when more kids are out and a night especially where you need to be alert. He said that he lives close and has done it before. He also said, “it’s not like I fell asleep at the wheel, I remember it all.” All of his responses seemed pretty bad to me. I feel very disrespected because I asked him not to drive drunk (something I shouldn’t have had to ask) but he still did it even though there were other options.\n\nMy question is, do I continue dating him after this? These qualities are not great for a long term partner and I’m only 3 months in. That being said, he is incredibly kind to me and does treat me very well. Any advice is helpful I am struggling because I have so much love and care for him but also want to think about myself and my future. ",

    "title": "How to navigate my girlfriends strict parents?",
    "selftext": "Me and my gf (both 22) have been dating for a few months. Her parents are extremely strict for a 22 year old. The latest I've seen her alowed out of the house is about 9pm (thats when she was meeting my parents, the usual is 8pm) aside from a few family functions. She has to ask permission every time she leaves the house and they say no quite often. She pays a lot to her parents in rent too which considering how strict they still are with her just baffles me. With our work schedules it feels like we only get a few hours to see each other on any given day when we actually can. And her moving out is not viable at this point with how expensive rent is. \n\nI always assumed that they would eventually ease up and it was because I was the new boyfriend that they were being so strict on her. Well recently she told me that its more of a cultural thing and that her cousin who is over 30 years old with 3 kids (still living with her parents) has to ask permission to leave the house. \n\nAt first it didn't bother me because I really do love her, but its getting to the point where its preventing us from doing basic things that people in relationships are supposed to do. Going to a bar for a drink with eachother is out of the picture. Her sleeping over is absolutely never gonna happen. And its honestly starting to become a hinderance. It also seems like she is unwilling/wanting to communicate to her parents that she needs more freedom. \n\nI'm an extremely responsible person and her parents know that I wouldn't ever put their daughter in harms way. At this point it feels like her family expects other peoples lives to completely revolve around them and their wishes. Most of the time me and my girlfriend hang out its at her house because she doesn't have a curfew if shes already home. But I don't really like doing this because the whole time we are around her family and when we do get to hang out in her room the door has to be open (there isn't locks even if we wanted to close the door). \n\nHow do I navigate this? I don't want to break up with her but this will definitely lead to unhappiness for the both of us if it persists. ",

I also come from a culture where parents are strict on their kids especially their daughters, so I know how hard it is for her as well. She definitely seems unwilling to speak up for herself but she needs to realize if she’s old enough to be paying rent, she’s old enough to have freedom. I think she doesn’t want to disappoint her family and be on bad terms with them, so she holds back out of fear. She needs to learn how to stand up for herself. You can’t expect her to cause problems in her household for you but I definitely recommend sitting her down and having a serious conversation. You need to explain to her that this is causing problems in your relationship and make her realize that she’s paying rent so she should be able to do whatever she wants. Explain how you feel and hopefully she tries speaking to them but realistically, I don’t see this situation changing a lot unless she starts to rebel or you guys get married. It’s unfair to you and it’s unfair to her, I wish you guys the best!",

    "selftext": "\n\nI '35+M' recently proposed to my girlfriend '30+F' and gave her a ring, which unexpectedly became a source of tension and conflict. We've been together for over a year now, and I wanted to finally propose and give her a ring that I thought was perfect. I proposed without discussing it with her first, and she accepted. We’re both over 30, working professionals, and we live in different countries. We meet about every three months and spend a lot of time on long calls. I proposed because I wanted her to marry me and eventually move in with me.\n\nRecently, she called and complained that the ring wasn’t what she had hoped for. I understood her point and agreed, especially since we hadn’t discussed any specifics about the ring. We’re from different cultures, which may have contributed to the misunderstanding. I assured her that I chose the ring as a symbol of my love and mentioned she could upgrade it once we’re married. We talked about it for hours, but she remained focused on the ring's size and cost, expressing that she expected something worth over $2,000. I explained that I don’t earn in dollars and could get her a more expensive ring after we’re married.\n\nDespite my attempts to reassure her, she kept saying I didn’t understand her feelings. Frustrated, I repeated my suggestions, thinking I had been clear. But the next day, the same argument came up. I asked her what I could say to make her feel better, but she just repeated things I’d already said. When I pointed this out, she seemed distant and said I still didn’t understand her feelings. I reassured her again about upgrading the ring after marriage, and we ended the call on what I thought was a positive note.\n\nHowever, yesterday she called and told me she was unsure about our relationship, bringing up the same concerns again. I felt a surge of panic, but I calmed myself and asked why she didn’t trust my assurances. She didn’t have an answer, just repeated the same points until I broke down. I told her that if she wanted to leave, she could, but she insisted she wasn’t suggesting a breakup—just sharing her worries that our relationship might not last. We spoke for 5 hours that day. My fiance has never been good at communicating as I feel. I suggest several time that she should share her feelings and communicate. She has the habit of spacing out and processing her emotion for days. That is something I don't do. I dod complain to her since the beginning of our relationship about her lack of communication. She promised to me several time that she will work on her communication but she never did.\n\nAfter this incident, we have decided to work on ourselves but now I am unsure about her. I am afraid that she will bring this up and leave.",

    "title": "What would you give your parents as a gift for their 30+year marriage anniversary, when you know there's no romance in their relationship and they're more like roommates than anything?",
    "selftext": "Family structure: Me (32F), Mom (52F), Dad (53M). I haven't lived with my parents for the past 8 years.\n\nMy parents will be celebrating their 33rd anniversary soon and I'm at a loss as to what kind of gift to get or make. I'm hoping anyone would have an idea of what to look for.\n\nMy parents' relationship has been a rocky rollercoaster to say the least. They had me when they were 20 and they had to get married because of the pregnancy. My dad has always loved my mom, however, my mom has a very difficult time with anything intimate, physical, mental and emotional. \n\nDue to undiagnosed mental issues, we've all grown up in violent and neglectful households. There's lots of trauma in all 3 of us, and even though the mental issues are being treated, we still have a lot of issues with a lot of mundane stuff. These issues are a great factor in my mom's difficulties with intimacy. She's even expressed discomfort when hugging me, but also has assured me that she'd never refuse a hug from me, because she loves me. \n\nWhen I was little, my parents fought a lot. There's been years where it was every day, and I remember feeling weird about having a full week without crying. Most of the fights were due to small misunderstandings and communication errors and all 3 of us just generally not understanding one another because of the undiagnosed mental issues. Life got a lot better after we started getting those issues diagnosed and treated, but a lot of damage will always remain. Nowadays life is calm, with the occasional heated discussion that is shut down quite quickly. There hasn't been any violence since our collective diagnoses 12 years ago. \n\nEven though I haven't lived with my parents for 8 years now, we are still very close and open about any difficulties because of our past. They've told me about any and all issues they've had and they often ask my opinion about those matters as well. \n\nMy mom has floated the idea of divorce quite often, mostly after they'd had another fight. They've considered it seriously a couple years ago after my mom finished an inpatient therapy course for PTSD. They decided to stay together because my mom is just as dependent on my dad as he is on her. I agree with anyone thinking they should've divorced decades ago or not even have gotten married in the first place, and I have made my opinion clear to them, but it's their relationship and their choice. \n\nTo sum up my parents' relationship and interactions nowadays:\n\n\\- They don't sleep in the same room.  \n\\- They rarely hug and if they do, it's because my dad prompted it.  \n\\- My mom rarely tells anybody she loves them. She shows it in other ways however.   \n\\- My mom has told me she doesn't feel romantic love towards my dad, but rather feels like a roommate.   \n\\- Their overall connection has gotten a lot better now that they understand each other.  \n\\- They'd both fall apart if they were to leave.   \n\\- They'd rather stay together in a familiar situation they know is flawed, than go out and pursue something new.  \n\\- A myriad of mental issues influences everything they do and feel. \n\nAnd somehow, they still want to celebrate their marriage. What would you get as a gift? Any type of marriage celebration gift I can find is based on love (of course), but that doesn't seem right. I like making things. I'd love to make them something small but unique. \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Me '19f' and my bf '18m'  have been together for 2 years. He's sweet and nice to me, but I feel so unsatisfied. He does things that do make me feel happy, like buys stuff (i was buying everything before he got his new job), he got his license so we could drive around together, he never leaves me on opened when messaging, we never fight etc. \nBut there's so much that's lacking and I don't know if what I'm feeling is valid or if I'm just never happy lol. \nSo in the two years that weve been together he's never helped or made me finish, whenever we have sex, I always feel like hes never doing anything. I'm always making the 1st move, I always feel as though I'm just doing all the work to pleasure him and then that's it. Which really is just making me feel ugly and turned off. Sometimes I dont even feel like he wants me. \nBut on the emotional side of things, whenever I talk to him about something I want to or need to talk about, I feel like he dismisses me or just relates it back to himself in some way. Often when I get about something upsetting me, he'll end up crying and I have to comfort him instead. He always says we'll be together for the rest of our lives, which I want, but  I feel like he doesn't put in effort where I need it. I feel like he thinks I'll never leave or something, and he doesn't have to put in any work. \nAnd yes I've talked to him before about it. But he instantly gets sad and just says sorry over and over and then I just end up making him upset. I don't know if this is my fault.  I just wish I was happier and prettier.  maybe id seem more attractive to him and he'd want to take the time to care. I don't know \n\nIm not perfect either. Im very insecure and always am asking for reassurance. I get jealous/ insecure about other girls he knows, I wish I wasnt like that. I've tried to be more confident. I also am so worried a lot and just feel so sad a majority of the time. \n \nI just don't know what to do. \n\n**I'm his first ever girlfriend. So I know it takes time and patience!

    "selftext": "\n\nHey guys, me (20F) and my boyfriend (22M) of 3 1/2 years got into a heated argument and are taking some space to ourselves, not a break but just not hanging out for a week or so. The argument was basically about how Ive been feeling like his mother since February in terms of having to remind him to clean after himself and reminding him of self hygiene and it was just me finally being pushed over the edge when I came back home after a trip to see that he made my apartment messy and smelly when it wasn’t at the time I left. After feeling like I was prying him for answers as to why he’s like this, he apologized and said it’s because he was let go of his job in February. But I can’t help to feel different. I feel like all of those moments of me having to mother him, reminding him to not put empty stuff in fridge, asking him if he’s gonna start working out again, telling him his breath smelled bad, telling him to make the bed, to pick up his socks subconsciously made me lose some feelings at least romantically. And he never once told me that he was upset from losing his job and I always tell him that he can be open with me because we’re each others person BUT he never did so for all this time, I was just feeling annoyed at him and thinking he had no real reason for it. I feel so incredibly guilty for feeling this way because I know I love him so much but it reached the point where I’m thinking if he’s even my person and the person I want to marry because if you let yourself go after losing one job then that’s bad. I feel like you have to be stronger than that especially since he wants to go to law school so all of that stress will be magnified.  I also feel horrible for feeling like I might of lost feelings because he’s always been there for me and accepts me for me. He’s loyal, takes me out, has not yelled at me the whole relationship until this argument, and makes me feel like the only girl in the world and I love that but I can’t be his mother. I’m scared that since he’s already acting like this with no job, no current school, and no financial responsibility that it will only get worse when we’re married, sharing bills, and both in a stressful career. He told me that he’s acting this way because he has no job to give him structure but do you really have to rely on a job for that? I’m just so overwhelmed by guilt because this is my first relationship so I’m not sure if this type of thing is a bad enough reason to stop dating him because everything else he does he great but I can’t stand being his mother. Has anyone been in a situation like this and what did you do?",

    "selftext": "I need others to help me decide if I should end my relationship.\n\nMy (F25) boyfriend (M27) and I have been together for the last 2.5 years and it’s been a rocky relationship the entire time. We definitely love each other so much and have grown a lot as people since we first started dating. When we first got together, we had our honeymoon phase as every couple does, but even right from the beginning there were red flags. But to be fair, I also was giving off red flags, as I was still operating on some of the beliefs I had coming out of my previous relationship. In my last relationship, we had reached a point where we decided to open up the relationship. While no one acted on this, we were at the point of accepting that it was a possibility for us to explore that. When I first started dating my now-boyfriend, I was very clear that that’s what I wanted still, and he did not want that. As time went on, I realized that I didn’t want to be in an open relationship, I just thought I felt that way, because my last relationship was already emotionally over for me before it actually ended. Anyway, throughout our time dating, my current boyfriend and I have made many changes in beliefs and values (all for the better) to enhance our relationship and I am very grateful for that. However, there are some major incompatibilities that still exist that cause me so much relationship anxiety and make me question if I’ll ever truly feel secure and happy in this relationship. My partner insists that we are compatible and used our growth over the past years to show that we can get through any obstacle. I just feel very unseen a lot of the time. An example is that I am more politically active than the average person and believe in the power of local politics. For this years election I did hours of research before filling out my ballot. I even served as a board member on a local food cooperative because it is my passion. Meanwhile, I just found out last night that my boyfriend hasn’t even looked at his ballot yet, and is planning to vote on his lunch break on Election Day. To me, this is just another example of how we are incompatible. I honestly feel so embarrassed as a former board member who had to run for election and who has crafted items to be voted on in our co-op’s elections to be dating someone this careless about his democratic voice. \n\nThis is just one among many incompatibilities I see. Should I break off the relationship?",

    "selftext": "I (25F) have been dating my bf (27M) for nearly 5 years, and I love him but I get such intense waves of doubt about our relationship.\n\nA bit about him: he is genuinely the sweetest guy ever, he is thoughtful, and supportive, and has a light and open heart, truly against all odds too. When we first started dating, I was in struggle city and he really gave me something that I didn't realise I needed, I think it was a space and love without condition like I hadn't experienced before. I can confidently say that I would not be where I am today were it not for whatever it was he did for me and continues to do for me.\n\nYet, here I am, on the cusp of finally finishing my studies, on the cusp of being able to begin to do all the things that we've been talking about doing when I finish studying (we have some really solid plans to go backpacking), and I can't help but wonder if there's something more? I feel like I should know, by this point, with this wonderful man, whether or not I want to be with him for the rest of my life, but I don't know. He knows... if I said I wanted to get married tomorrow, he would get down on one knee. arghhh I just wish I knew what that felt like.\n\nWe're basically on the same page about things that we want in life, and roughly when we want them. We challenge each other in a good way, really, by all checks and balances, our relationship is so good.\n\nIt breaks my heart thinking about the fact that I am where I am today because of him, and so, because of him, I may have outgrown him. And the longer I leave this undecided, the more I am using and abusing him.\n\nI've felt like this before, to the point that I have raised it with him, just as something for me that is a concern that he deserves to know about. Every time I leave those conversations, I end up wondering why I ever felt like he wasn't my guy, he's so communicative and clear, and loves me so much.\n\nI keep fantasising about independence, travelling alone and spending some quality time with me, myself and I, and just seeing where these next 5 years take me.\n\nAnyways, I hear and read these horror stories about men, especially here on Reddit - I've clearly got it good here right? And I will feel like a massive fuck up if I waste it? Or will I turn around in 10 years and just wish I had had the guts?  \n  \nTL;DR: My bf loves me more than I do, but I don't know if I am just being greedy for wanting more.",

    "selftext": "Not sure what I'm expecting here but maybe some advice on next steps. \n\nBackground: 41m and I 37f have been dating for 6.5 years. Recently on an overseas trip we landed in a foreign airport and while looking for an exit, he told me that I really lack some basic navigation skills. I'd been tired from the 12hr flight with a headache so I told him very loudly and firmly can he please stop saying that (as I was already doing my best). He pretty much stopped talking and the next morning said he wanted to go home despite us having 3 week trip planned. He was actually searching for flights home on his phone. I was stunned. Told him i apologized for being louder than I should have been. He said what's the point of apologizing if that's just who you are - always having angry outbursts when you didn't need to. (Over the years occasionally I did get annoyed/angry when perhaps I lost a game but not often and almost not at all in the last 2 years).\n\nAnyway, he was uninterested in me trying to talk things through so I left to explore the city on my own, telling him that I wished to see him at least one last time if he did decide to go. About two hours later I got an email from a group in our home town announcing an event he was hosting that weekend (while we're still supposed to be travelling). I thought well he's really returning for real. But an hour later I got a text from him saying he's hungry basically meaning he wanted to meet up. When I got back to the hotel I gave him a big hug and he reciprocated. I asked for his thoughts & feelings but he didn't want to share which was typical of him. For the next two weeks we had a really good time and I took that as he moved on and might have realised he overreacted but just didn't want to admit to it. \nWhen we travelled to another country both of us kept calm and navigated the new airport really well and I felt proud of us. \n\nHowever this morning, he suddenly stopped talking to me. I had no idea why. Yesterday we visited a seaside town, generally had a good time although in the afternoon I was a bit tired/grumpy from hiking as it was more difficult than I anticipated. I wanted to have a local snack so he told me we can walk for an hour to where the snacks were. On the way he wanted to see some sights but I asked him whether it would take extra time as I was really hungry. He reluctantly agreed to head to the snack area, but got annoyed after I just bought a snack from a random store 10min from the original destination. I suspect he was pissed that he gave up sights for me to have good snacks but that I couldn't wait. Eventually I apologized saying I really want both of us to get what we wanted but maybe I focussed too much on my needs and I was upset he didn't get his needs/wants. I was crying and he seemed to feel I was overreacting, hugged me and held my hand for the rest of the day. We had a good night and agreed to wake up at 9am next day for breakfast. \n\nSo this morning, 9am I woke him up...he wouldn't budge. Plan went out the window as I waited for him to get ready and packed slowly. He barely talked to me or looked at me. When we got to our next hotel at night, he still didn't talk so I hugged him, telling him I hated seeing him sad but didn't know how I can help. He then began crying. For some reason I decided to tell him all my thoughts and feelings over the past few days about the trip (basically how we had ups and downs but I felt we moved on well and I feel communication is important etc). He just cried silently more, and then wouldn't even let me touch him anymore.\n\nThis is where we are now. It's 8pm and I've been sitting in the hotel with him for the last 3hrs or so. \n\nI feel dumb as communication is one way but I also don't want to leave him, as there's definitely some intense sadness he can't verbalise at the moment. I just don't know what they are. ",

My husband is an amazing person and caregiver, which is awesome because since he’s a disabled vet, he can stay home with the kids and already has an income. The problem? I’m always gone. We went from living on his income alone and barely getting by, but also being able to both care for the children… to me working constantly and there’s no real way to get out of the work there is to be done sometimes. It’s not a job where you just leave at a certain time. You leave when the work is done. \n\nMy question? For those with high demand jobs, what do you do with your spouses to spend quality time in the late hours or one day off you get? We love sports and we watch those together, but I want to be able to do things that:\n\nA) won’t wake the kids when we have to hang out late at night, but that we can do together. \n\nB) remind my husband that I still love hanging out and being with him.\n\nC) also includes suggestions on things that could include children since our only alone time is at night. \n\nI get Sundays off too if that helps anyone come up with anything lol. We go to the zoo sometimes, play video games, occasionally see movies, but I’m just about to have a lot less free time and I’m trying to plan ahead.

    "selftext": "my now ex I broke up with about a week ago bcos he never cared to voice anything nice about me. This is the reason why I needed to leave. I loved him more than anything I loved him through everything he betrayed me multiple times yet I stayed and loved him. I lost my virginity to him. I was so crazily attracted to him aswell and would always always always express my attraction towards him and how he would make me feel especially sexually. But I could walk naked around him and he would look at me and just say something like “what are you doing” or “can you please go wear something” that’s the most I would get. Every time I would get glammed up for him he would not even as to give me one compliment. He would always very obviously be shy and nervous around me sometimes and his penis would be hard around me sometimes and I could see in his eyes he’s either getting turned on or is very into me in that moment but he wouldn’t do anything about it. He wouldn’t even say anything to me to let me know that’s he attracted to me right now. There would be times where I wanted him to fuck me so bad bcos he wouldn’t fuck me for weeks always some excuse. And it wasn’t just the fucking part that I wanted. I wanted to be touched by him I wanted to feel wanted for a few minutes, I wanted someone to look at me full of lust, I wanted a man’s touch and to grab me and kiss me with passion, I mostly just wanted to feel pretty and wanted by him. The sex wasn’t as important as him just hugging my body and touching me. So sometimes when I’d see an opportunity like when I’m sleeping over at his house and nobody is home (he lived alone) only me and him and the whole day would go by not a single bit of sexual attention would he give to me so I’d try ignoring it and then night time would come and I’d naturally get more hornier knowing it’s only me and him and it’s night time we’re in the same bed. I would wear something sexy that I had been waiting all day to wear and shower basically ready to be dicked down lol and come into bed with him and he would just barely cuddle me, say a few things and when I’d see no action from his end I’d back my ass up to his dick and he would be like “omg what are you doing”. And he would know I’m horny.  while I’m waiting for him to make a move I start to hear snoring and he’s deep asleep. Naturally these things used to make me so so so so upset and hurt and I would voice that and tell him how much this affects me. And he would genuinely not change it’s just how he was with me the biggest thing for me was he was never like this with any other girl he was so extremely sexual with other woman even the ones he cheated on me with. I have spoken to woman from his past he was so sexual driving hours sometimes to other states to meet them and fuck them and he would always always always compliment other woman he was never scared to tell a woman how beautiful she looks. I’ve seen his old messages with girls and he would be so nice and sweet and sexual with them. It hurts that I haven’t been told I’m beautiful by him in months. And also to mention I’m a very clean hygienic girl I keep everything clean and tidy my body hygiene is really good and I never smell bad or anything like that I’m always cleaned and showered especially when I see him I make sure to always smell good and be extra clean I even use special products and eat a healthy diet to make everything downstairs taste and smell nice just for him. I also go to the gym and am considered a hot girl I have a nice body and face. \n\nI had to leave him because of this. We had been together 3 years at this point and I just couldnt do it any more it was so so so exhausting. I was sick and tired of having to ASK. Asking for sex begging to be complimented. Asking for a hug asking for him to hold my hand asking for him to walk beside me not 10feet ahead of me. Begging to be taken on a date without him being in a mood the whole night. I don’t want to ask. I wish someone would just do these things without me having to ask and beg. I don’t want to ask someone to have sex with me I don’t want to ask somebody to call me beautiful. So am I wrong for wanting to leave him and find someone who would do the things he wouldn’t? Is it wrong of me to leave and only bcos I want affection ? I feel guilty even looking at another guy let alone flirting. I feel guilty for wanting to have sex with other men, a man who wants to touch me and wants to kiss me. I just want to have sex and do everything people who like each other and are attracted to each other do without the feeling of shame. He used to make me feel so much shame for wanting affection. \n Also to add, no he is not gay at all and he has moments of affection for me very little tho. I know he truly loves me bcos of the things he has done for me he funds my entire living and shows and proves his love for me through other things but it’s only the affectionate and sexual part that our relationship is lacking so much. \nWhy do I feel so guilty leaving him?",

    "title": "My boyfriend got too comfortable in the relationship",
    "selftext": "\n\n\nHey guys, I just want to know if anyone’s been in a situation like this and what did you do. I (20F) unofficially live with my boyfriend(22 M) of 3 1/2 years, it’s my apartment but he stays for around 3/4 days out of the week and we have 2 cats together. Idk if someone will ask but he does not pay any type of rent. So I went on a trip this weekend for 4 days and asked him to be at home during that time to watch the cats and he did. I just came back home this morning to the nastiest odor as soon as I opened the door and he was there just now about to start scooping the litter box. Same with the sink/dishwasher and trash can. He didn’t scoop the litter box in 4 days, didn’t clean the kitchen once, and there were smelly socks all over the living room floor with the couch pillows and blankets also tossed on the floor. Keep in mind that I cleaned and organized the apartment when I left. I genuinely got so livid because I was tired, hungry, and just drove for 3 hours to get home and you’re telling me he didn’t start cleaning a single thing in the 4 days I was gone until he saw that I was finally home AND made my apartment smell bad??? I called him out and he literally just said “that’s my bad”. He also wasn’t put together himself like not showered and teeth not brushed so all of my excitement for coming home and seeing him was just gone. He’s always been loyal and respectful and a good boyfriend in general but this stuff pisses me off so much because it’s not the first time and it’s actually always been kind of an issue that he doesn’t clean/help with chores and I feel like I’m his mom that has to remind him to clean after himself and do basic hygiene. I just feel like he’s too comfortable in the relationship and doesn’t care anymore when I always make sure that I look/smell good every time I see him no matter what. I’ve brought this up in the past when he saw me cleaning up his mess in the kitchen but he only ever helps with that stuff if I basically nag him. I feel like he should have kept my apartment clean and made it nice to come home to out of niceness at least since he doesn’t like cleaning. I feel so bad for thinking negatively of him because everything else he does is fine and I love him but this is a big issue to me and I’m scared of it developing into something worse especially since I’ve already brought it up before.",

Chances are you'll need to relax your standards a bit, at least as far as he's concerned. But he has to start pulling at least some of his own weight. That means cleaning and cooking, washing and drying, and all those other boring tasks that come with living away from his mom, which, as you have pointed out, you're not.

        "comment_body": "Especially at a younger age - but I'd say for many people always - it's easy to lose track of what one has and how things can slowly deteriorate over time, step by step. Similar to gaining weight or losing control over something. And you 2 are both very young, I think some commenters forget that, I don't really like the approach of \"Something doesn't fit? Quit.\", if every relationship would go down like that none would last. This doesn't mean endless BS has to be accepted, but I mean the instant jump to it.\n\nWhat I'd do is take a closer look at the pattern that he uses when he responds to you pointing something out and already preparing to go against that. Dodging a question, avoiding it by focusing on another topic or lifting up a negative with a \"but \\[insert positive/reason\\]\" is really common, and I'd advice to already throttle it there, but not in an aggressive way. No one here can tell what is going through his mind and even as a partner that's rarely fully possible, so I'd take it slow and confront him - with the plan in mind - in a way that makes it clear how important that is and what it means to you, but also what the consequences would be if nothing improves or gets worse. For this you can also make a list of things that you provide, what he provides, how you weight them importance wise and show with that how you see both people of the relationship.\n\nIf none of this works or you notices he pushes against you and you don't want to end it there, then it might be a good choice to take a break from the relationship - not where both do whatever, but rather to use the distance to see how it is without each other, mostly that he realizes what value you have. It could be a week, 2 weeks or a month where you live separated and he will start realizing that you are contributing a lot for the life of you 2 while he is not really doing anything, or not enough. Though I would word this carefully since if you don't want to end things completely, you don't want to come across as taking this as an escape and ending things, it's a very emotional topic.",

    "title": "Girlfriend has exclusively male friends… am I right in thinking this is weird?",
    "selftext": "Apologies in advance for the essay\n\nMy girlfriend (18F, I am 20M) is friends with exclusively guys. She has zero girl friends. And I’m not talking close friends, I mean ANY female friends in general. The guys who she is friends with are people who constantly lie and cheat on their own girlfriends compulsively and don’t support our relationship at all. They have never asker to meet me and have even gone as far as to talk shit about me behind my back to her, have hit on her and talk to her through social media essentially everyday (nothing flirty just stuff friends would talk about as far as I’ve seen). I have met one of them so far, and I thought all went well, until my girlfriend told me that the only thing the guy said to the rest of his friend group, after meeting me, was that I asked too many questions and that he found it annoying (the questions I asked were completely normal and standard questions you would ask anyone who you meet for the first time. Was literally just getting to know him; what are you studying etc.) I wasn’t in his face or anything, just tried to act as friendly as possible - he barely asked me anything about myself. Apart from this one time, none of them have ever asked to meet me. But despite this, she remains friends with them, and she shows no sign that any of this bugs her. \n\nShe has asked them a good few times whether she could bring me to one of their dinners/events/hangouts and they have always said no: “Next time maybe”. She’s told me they never ask about me either. One of them has even gone as far as to say to my girlfriend over text “You’re standing up to your boyfriend over me? Does he even respect you? He doesn’t even know how to be in a relationship… he’s weird”. This is a guy who I have never met and have never had any interaction with, apart from one very polite and un-confrontational short message I sent him asking him to stop sending romantic Instagram reels and dozens of “I miss you” messages to her after she had told him to stop many many times. Thankfully she had shut down all of these messages that he sent her instantly and didn’t entertain any of his pursuits in the slightest. She backed me up when he brought it up to her and didn’t mind that I sent him a message. But anyway, after all this, she wants to continue friendships with him and people like this? I could include a lot of other examples of what these guys are like but I want to keep things fairly short. \n\nI wouldn’t think too much if this is she had even 1 or 2 close girlfriends as part of the group, but the thing that’s starting to get to me slightly is that she does not have a single friend who is a girl. What confuses is that she appears so trustworthy and loyal, has never seen any of these guys one-on-one, but doesn’t see a problem with the way they act. She seems so far removed from what these guys are like and I don’t understand how someone like her would want to surround herself with people like this. I mean for Christ sake, one of them showed the whole group a video of him having sex with his girlfriend, while talking about how he wants to cheat so badly. I asked her at the beginning of our relationship that I’m not really comfortable with her hanging out with only guys if they’re people like this and since that conservation, there has always been a girl with them, but the girl is almost always one of the guys’ girlfriends who she seems to barely interacts with. She’s never pursued any sort of friendship with them and never talks to them again after meeting them. She’s never invited any of her own girlfriends because she doesn’t have any and there’s no girls (apart from her) in the friend group apart from her.\n\nI’m just confused I guess, and I’m not trying to complain or whinge about this because: I feel like our relationship is actually extremely strong, and so far, nothing has ever happened between her and any of these guys. We have each other on life360, she openly lets me use her phone whenever she wants me to, she’s never lied, cheated, entertained any guys’ pursuits on her and has only been honest, transparent and genuine with me. She shows me her messages with them and I have only seen her shut them down. To clarify, only one or two of these guys has tried to talk to her in a flirty way, the rest I’m not really fond of because of how they don’t support our relationship, criticise me behind my back, don’t wanna meet me and because they are bragging about how often they wanna cheat on their own girlfriends. \n\nI really have no reason to doubt her loyalty and she has continually reassured right from the beginning. I feel like I treat her incredibly well, I have always respected her, have never gotten aggressive and have always been supportive kind, caring and selfless towards her because I love her heaps. I treat her as best as I possibly, and she does the same towards me. The thing I just don’t understand is why she feels the need to continue friendships with exclusively guys who are inherently toxic & misogynistic and why she’s unable to make friends with any girls at all. Does anyone think there’s a reason for this? I could never be around anyone who talks shit about my girlfriend and I’d definitely distance myself from any of my friends if they started to continually cheat, let alone brag about it. \n\nI have brought this up to her a few times, and even she has even admitted to me that they’re shitty people and that she has barely anything in common with them, but has always assured me that they will never influence her and that she “can’t change how they are”.\n\nFor some more context, it seems like she has always been like this: no female friends. To contextualise things a little: I’m white Australian and she is from Hong Kong. She moved to Perth at the beginning of 2024 to study and all of these friends I’ve mentioned are Asian. All asian guys. Met through uni so she sees them pretty often. From what I’ve gathered, ber parents also share the same views and don’t seem to like her friends much at all, probably because of all the same reasons. As someone who was raised in western culture, I’ve never seen anyone’s girlfriend be part of a friend group of EXCLUSIVELY guys, and not having any female friends. Maybe I’m overthinking this a shit tonne everything I have ever known about relationships tells me this isn’t normal.\n\nI’m 19M and she is 18F, we have been dating for 5 months. Thanks for taking the time to read. Does anyone have any ideas of how to approach this situation and what they would do if they were me? ",

    "selftext": "Looking for honest advice. Current situation:\n\n- Been dating for approximately 3 years\n- Had a crush on her twice before dating and got entirely over her between the first and second time.\n- Started dating more from curiosity/caring/practical choice than strong feelings, but I was obviously excited to start dating in a general sense.\n- She's amazing and is genuinely my best friend - great values, treats me well, and I deeply care about her\n- But I don't feel that baseline romantic love/excitement\n- I’m dealing with porn addiction and heavy stimulant use that could, in theory, but probably don’t affect my feelings\n- I sometimes feel disgust/cringe/negative reactions in response to things she does, (strangely) so when she does things that show respect/care (might be related to my self-worth issues but also could be because of deep-seated guilt for potentially leading her on) but also when she seems to be unfunny or less smart at times.\n- I can enjoy simple moments but missing natural romantic feelings\n- I want badly to love her romantically\n- I feel nauseous at thought of losing her but also at thought of never feeling real romance as well as the thought of robbing her of the opportunity to be fully loved\n\nQuestion: Could working through addiction/self-worth issues potentially lead to developing genuine romantic love? Or am I hoping for something that won't develop if baseline attraction isn't there? She's genuinely amazing and I want this to work more than anything, but I don't want to waste her time if it won't.\n\nTL;DR: Don't feel baseline romantic love for amazing girlfriend despite wanting to. Could fixing porn addiction/self-worth lead to real love or am I forcing something that won't happen?",

When I go to parties with my friends and I drink he doesn’t like it and it’s not like am a party animal\n, I really like nature much more than parties , I just go sometimes , like the Halloween party . And I went to a 2 Halloween parties this time because one of them was in my hostel and I got drunk and had bad effect because of poor quality of alcohol , while he wasn’t in the town. And he got really mad on me about this, and he keeps passing these judgements how this is bad and it’s my fault if I had a bad effect on my body. I was feeling very bad in stomach and also had some vomiting and whole day I was weak and I just wanted to share with him that am feeling sick, but he didn’t care he just kept on scolding me how bad is that and it’s all my fault for doing this party and drinking. That was still fine we got normal and I decided to be normal I sent him some costume and make up pictures, and pictures with some friends in party , and his reaction wasn’t good he said he doesn’t like seeing this bad things like partying and drinking, and he got jealous over a picture with a guy, where am just standing with the guy not even too close, and asked me how would you feel if I send you picture like this , and I was like “it’s fine it would be normal” but nope , he kept on acting strange. He keeps taunting me that there was no need for me to go in 2 parties. I mean they were on complete different days and I wanted to go it was my choice. He keeps passing these judgements that make me feel guilty about doing things I might enjoy , I like experimenting with cons times , nice outfits and looks and his comments stay in my head and make m feel\nBad. He says he isn’t stopping me from doing these things , but he doesn’t like them. I just am in love that I keep ignoring this signs of red flags , am I too blinded . I really need some objective or neutral opinion on it. He never admits that he is controlling , or manipulating or even judgemental but he keeps passing these bad judgements.

As you said, you are a free spirit, while your boyfriend seems to adhere to a more conservative and insecure vision of a relationship. This doesn't mean you or him are wrong, just, unfortunately, incompatible in this regard. \n\nNow, if your boyfriend is generally controlling like that, making you doubt yourself and creating a need of getting his approval for everything, that might be a serious sign of him having a truly manipulative/controlling behaviour. What I want to point out is, if he is only acting like that when you are surrounded by other people without him around, he might just be insecure in this relationship. That means, something is preventing him from fully trusting that you will be a loyal girlfriend. Deep down, he fears being betrayed, and that makes him act in a sort of hypervigilant and aggressive way. Does that mean it's okay? Hell no! But it is a starting point, if you want to discuss about it. \n\nIf his fear of betrayal leads to behavior that restricts your freedom or induces guilt, then it’s a dynamic that needs addressing, even if it comes from an insecurity.\n\nThe only solution here is either to discuss about his insecurity or find a common ground. Maybe a past relationship left him hurt over a betrayal, who knows? In the end, you both might have to compromise, if you wish to continue further with this relationship. If this is a deal-breaker for you, I understand fully, and you're fully within rights to look for a relationship where you get what you deserve. After all, trust should be a given in such a relationship, you don't need to feel like you have to fight for it or earn it.",

He has never ever mentioned this girl before and I couldn't understand why she couldn't stay at the person's phd defence that she came to see? Just seemed strange to me but idk. He didn't seem to want to say much about her the next day, he kinda kept all the details vague about how his night with her had been. I asked him if anything happened and he promised it didn't. Not even a kiss.\nAnyway earlier today he tells me that she's coming to stay the night again tomorrow, he said that she booked an apartment from the 6th but her train is booked for the 5th so she has to stay the night. I don't understand why she's coming a day earlier if she had nowhere to stay? Feels like to me she's coming a day early just to stay with my bf and surely she knows someone else in Belgium so why does she always have to stay with my bf? I haven't asked why she's coming early or what apartment he means, is she moving to Belgium? Is it an Airbnb she's booked? I don't wanna seem like the jealous crazy gf by asking all these questions. I don't know anything about this girl and as I've said he's never mentioned her before until she stayed that first time. I've gone kinda crazy looking for her social media profiles but can't find anything where he's a mutual friend. \nWhat are your thoughts? Is it sketchy or just me being jealous?",

Huge since my family hasn’t been to our house since we got it 1 year ago and because it will be about an 8hour drive for them. They will be here a week. We also have our dog, a tall golden doodle - sweetest girl named June Bug. She has free range of the house as she’s trained. She does get excited with people and go up to them and will jump on them. (I know jumping bad - but when I come home I love her to jump up so I can give her a hug). \n\nMy sister is terrified of dogs. Almost didn’t accept the invite because of our dog. (Got attacked as a kid). I offered to kennel Juney while she was here because as much as I love June Bug, I love my sister and want to see her and want her to see our new home, plus I haven’t seen her in years. She agreed to come if I kennel her. \n\nI told my fiancé the good news that she accepted but that June would be kenneled most of the week. He said no and that we would not kennel her to accommodate my sister. There is no beef, he just feels it’s unfair to June since she primarily lives here. He’s not willing to kennel her that long - for the meals sure, but not the entire time. We have a backyard but June leans more into the poodle and likes the inside. \n\nI feel there has to be a solution. I understand his point and fully see mine. I’m scared if I tell my sister my fiancé said no to kenneling June, she won’t come and thanksgiving will be missing a family member. I don’t feel me choosing my human sister means I love June less. \n\nAny advice?",

    "selftext": "over the weekend I (F21) was out with my girl friends for Halloween and my bf (M21) was with us and we were all standing on the sidewalk and these 2 white guys walked past us and disrespectfully cat called our costumes and immediately my bf goes “fat ass n-word” in retaliation bc I was disrespected (not hard r, which ik does not matter at all but it’s context for the rest of the post). Naturally, my friends were shocked and so was I and I was incredibly embarrassed bc I do not condone anyone who isn’t black to say the word. I got VERY upset with him and my friends were definitely talking abt it w each other, which I don’t blame them for. Later my bf explained to me that since he grew up in the Bronx, the majority of people he grew up around said it and his friends gave him “the pass” and what not bc it’s never really used as a derogatory term or as a slur where he’s from. He said he has removed it from his vocabulary, (aside from this night ig…) and when he used to use it, it was never in a derogatory way, only a friendly one. He also said he understands that outside of where he’s from, the word is not seen or taken the way he knows and he understands that the way he reacted was horrible and embarrassing for me and that he shouldn’t have said that. Still, I’m VERY conflicted about this situation because I feel like my friends are judging me for being with someone who would say that and I’ve been questioning if maybe they’re right to judge me. I love my boyfriend, we met in college and we’ve been together for almost 2 years now. I feel really guilty about holding this against him and letting it reevaluate our relationship bc ik he’s a good person at heart and he feels very badly about saying what he did and realizes it was a BIG mistake. However, I do not agree with what happened and I’m wondering if I’m making a bad decision trying to move on from it. Please help idk what to do🙏🙏🙏\n ",

    "selftext": "I'm a (27F), he's a (23M). We've been seeing each other for over a month and are now in a relationship as of about a week ago. Was completely unexpected.\n\nHe hasn't seriously dated anyone in roughly 5 years, I haven't dated anyone in 3.\n\nHe has very very little experience in romantic relationships, I'm his second partner, whereas I have had partners for roughly 7 years of my adult life.\n\nOne of my biggest, most annoying and problematic faults is needing everything, especially things in my home like cooking/cleaning/tidying/organizing to be done exactly how I like it or I micro-manage and in turn make them feel unappreciated. I think half of why I do this is so they understand me better, but it doesn't feel good for either of us if I don't approach it gently in a teaching moment way. The other half is my anxiety and needing things to be how I like them or it freaks me out. I have lived with partners, but the last 3 years I have lived alone and have become even more particular and controlling with my space.\n\nThis is made worse by the fact that he's never really shared a space with anyone and lacks common sense and courtesy. Not necessarily his fault. So I have to explain basically everything to him in detail which overwhelms me and I get a bit snappy. Especially within the last two weeks of being under extreme pressure with work. Before then I was more gentle but still annoying.\n\nThis aspect of me in a relationship usually doesn't manifest this soon, but he spends a lot of time at my house. At some point during every night we hangout were cooking and cleaning up. If i don't see him do something the way I don't prefer it, wspecially when he helps and I'm not home, it's fine. If I do, that's when I begin bitching, being naggy or micromanaging. This also applies to things outside of the home like driving or shopping but those aren't frequent.\n\nLike I said, this has affected every romantic relationship I have ever had when we share my space. However I've always chalked it up to \"this is just how I am\". I realize that was shitty now. They never tried to get better for our relationship either so that made me want to do it less. It's different this time.\n\nI don't have OCD. I have situational anxiety and deep rooted perfectionism. I don't half ass anything, ever. When other people do it sets me off. Perfectionism affects many other areas of my life, but never other people. If you have experienced this, or have had a partner who was similar that you helped worked through to better your relationship, please offer advice. I don't want to be like this, but I after so many years can't figure out how not to be. I'm no longer able to afford therapy to help with coping.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I'm an open book.\n.\n.\n.\nAdditional information: Things like this often stem from traumatic childhoods in chaotic homes. Also being very detail oreinted and black and white thinking. All three of those apply here. I have worked heavily on not thinking in black and white during my 3 years of being single but haven't been able to work on this particularly with being outside of a relationship. ",

We have been together for 11 years and have 5 children. To make matters worse I was only 1 week postpartum with twins when I found it. We had talked in the past about porn and agreed it is not allowed in our relationship. I brought it up to him and he promised he would stop.. well guess what it’s October and I have found it again. He deleted all social media except Facebook and that’s where I found it. I literally quit my job to be a stay at home mom as a nurse and now just feel stuck. I can’t move on in this relationship. He says he’s not addicted and “it just popped up” so he clicked on it out of impulse. I know he’s lying. I know there is more than this. I set a clear boundary and he broke it. I honestly want a divorce. \n\nAlso are there any men out there not like this? Any men that don’t have to look elsewhere?? I literally just had twins. My body was at its lowest point and so was my self confidence and he’s looking at young girls with perfect bodies. I’m literally disgusted. Is settling for this just a standard in this day and age?

    "selftext": "This will be a longer post and trigger warning, it mentions death/loss of a loved one. For context, my mother passed away on October 1st and since then, I’ve been having a difficult time with everything in life. My boyfriend was helping me out the first few weeks but then he started acting like I was a chore to be taken care of and that he wasn’t getting any “alone time.” A few weeks ago, I came across messages of him and an old female friend exchanging sexually explicit messages and flirting. So I made him block her because we had problems about her before. He got mad at me for “going through his phone” and said it was an invasion of his privacy. But at the time, I went through it for medical reasons to reach his parents since I didn’t have their numbers. So the situation was settled for the time being. \n\nFast forward to last week, we get into another fight because he wanted to play Overwatch and I wanted him to watch movies with me and for some reason, I just didn’t want to be alone that night. So I tried to get him to come out of our bedroom, but he ignored me and then got mad at me because he said the “biggest job of all was trying to make sure I don’t cry or get upset” and that he needed to “recharge.” So I cried more because he was ignoring me and I was missing my mom that night and just wanted his company. \n\nApparently, that night he had sent messages to one of his other female friends who is older and considers herself an “older sister” to him but they only know each other online through discord. I found the messages last night and he had been venting to her about our fight. So, she contacted me last night and then wouldn’t leave me alone and started saying things like I’m a “controlling bitch” and other hateful things. She was harassing me and all my boyfriend did was sit there and try to apologize and not even say anything to her. He told me “don’t worry about it, I’ll have a talk with her.” But in reality, I’d rather him block her because I’m not comfortable with him being friends with her anymore. \n\nAt this point, I’m not even sure if we should be together. Should we just break up or still try to work the situation out? ",

I had been going to therapy, and that helped too.  I told people close to me I was going in that direction.  I also gathered a lot of evidence to use in the divorce trial if I had to.  I took photos of things, kept a journal because I had to use that information to keep him from driving her (he has an alcohol problem).  I wish I would have kept better record though, instead of just jotting down a small note and the date.  It worked out fine though.  I also told my daughter that Daddy was going to have to move out.

    "selftext": "\nSo, im writing this because i need to process this, and i need other thoughts and opinions on this. I have anxiety and i think a lot and i need an outlet, so whoever reads this i really appreciate it. Im going to write this post as factual as possible without any bias. My boyfriend (29M y/o Nigerian) and I (26F y/o AA) are 4 months pregnant. I have the sickle cell trait. I wanted him to get tested to see if he had the trait as well. He said he would get tested last Friday. We had been having the conversation for a month, i did research for him on providers that would accept his insurance. No one accepts his insurance for some reason besides urgent care, and providers that do accept his insurance do not provide that specific blood test. This debacle was over 2 weeks ago. Im a nurse and i work in an infusion clinic. I see patients on a daily basis who have sickle cell disease and the suffering they experience. So when he told me that he would get tested friday, I was really looking forward to it. Friday comes around and he doesnt get tested. This sends me into a crying spell because i feel so helpless and sad for my baby, because i cant make him get tested, and also im sad because i really wish i would have thought about all of this before having sex and choosing a partner, but its not something that i keep at the forefront of my mind because im a healthy individual so i forgot that i even had sickle cell trait. It was a conversation i had with my mom once when i was a child, so like i said it wasnt at the forefront of my head. But anyways… after him not going on friday i text him telling him that he is not taking the health of our child serious, nor my emotions, and that what he did was nonsense and that i do not want him to call me for a while (we are long distance). He tells me that i shouldnt talk to him that way and that i should learn how to communicate and that he didnt have time to go and that he is sorry and i should accept his apology because he would never treat me like that if i made a mistake. Saturday comes around and he tells me that im blaming him for what happens to the child and that its only my fault for being pregnant in the first place and whatever happens to the child’s health is my fault. After this i spend the whole day crying in bed and wishing i could die because ultimately, i blame myself as well, i know that it was my decision to keep the child because abortion is not something that im comfortable with. So i decide to break up with him that night. But now its monday morning and im really sad, i dont want to raise a child alone. I make good income and have a very supportive family, but i want my own family and i was my partner. But idk if i should want my partner. What can we do to have a healthy relationship? This isnt the first time he has blamed me. And he never even apologized for the first time. But he has also done a lot of supportive things and overall he is a good guy, but im nervous about him being a good father. The kicker part is (you all wont believe this), we have only known each other for 3 months. He wants me to marry him in December so he can stay in the country and be able to provide for me and the kid. I want to marry him because that sounds like a good plan. But im nervous because what if he isn’t supportive when i give birth, especially because he blames me for getting pregnant and keeping the child. What are some tips that yall have to continue our relationship happily and healthy? ",

    "selftext": "I’m (21F) and I have been with my bf (25M) for 5 years. i come from a deeply traumatic childhood/family life and he has helped me through so much. he has shown me unconditional love, support, care, kindness, etc and has given me everything he has. i fell so so deeply in love with him that it got me past the darkest parts of my life so far. we have been living together for 3 years now; we share finances (bills, our cats vet stuff, insurance) and he helps me with things likes taxes and buying a new car—things i have no idea how to do. i am uoung but i have no knowledge on how things like that work, i dont have family close enough to help me with that. what im saying is that we have become incredibly close.\n\n5 months ago i realized i had feelings for a coworker, which made me realize things i felt i was lacking in my relationship. my boyfriend and i are NOT sexually compatible, which is very important to me (not to him) and he does not give me the attention and validation i want. before him i had been in a 1 1/2 yr relationship, so ive been off the market since i was about 14. i want to know the single life, to be independent, to have my own space and my own time, to live young. i have had to mature at such a rapid rate and i already feel like im married. i want to sleep with other people. i told my boyfriend these things (yes, it was an embarrassing and emotional conversation, he was very mature but almost nonchalant about it. i didn’t feel like he put in much effort after the conversations but i know he loves me i do know), as much as it hurt, but i feel he just thinks im overthinking. he has been going through a rough spot because he lost a couple jobs back to back so he was always home and playing video games. i dont know if im still in love with him or not. my brain is so back and forth; on one hand i feel like im self sabotaging by ruining something good and chasing things that wont matter in the long run. but on the other hand i worry that im only with him for selfish reasons (it’s financially easier, i wont have to hurt his feelings more, hes a comfort that feels like all i know). the only thing i do know is he does not deserve the way ive treated him. i really really like my coworker, ive emotionally cheated on my bf with him for sure. i feel horrid in myself because my bf under no circumstance deserves that, yet im being immature and i keep doing it. if im questioning if im actually in love with him, what does that say? i know bumps are normal along the road but these feelings have been very prominent recently. i’ve felt them before but never like this. \n\ni did this with my ex and i fear im doing it again. will this pattern ever stop? is this just the universes way of telling me to step out of my comfort zone or to move on? or am i doomed to fall into selfish situations in every relationship? i know im young and have a lot more to learn but im so scared. i should break up with him right? but i dont have anywhere to go, i dont know how to live on my own, and what if im making a mistake? i’ve been pondering this for 4 months and i have yet to figure out how i feel—but is that because i just dont want to accept it? \n \ni think im also being selfish in the fact that he takes care of me in a way that has replaced my dad if that makes sense. my father was never emotionally available, was an addict, and died when i was 14. my bf has held me and supported me and cared for me the way my dad tried, but also in the ways my dad never could. it’s shallow, but i feel like i dont have anybody else \n\ni’m sorry this is all over the place, my brain is just so scrambled and confusing but i need help. i’m scared and cant keep doing the wrong thing. i know what im doing is not right, i just need advice. i dont know what im doing and i dont have anyone to go to it feels",

Yesterday she said me, that 2 months ago when she was with her friends, she smoked weed, and she is so sorry about it. Our dialogue was long, but at the end she promised that it was last time when she tasted something and lied at this theme. About lie, after this party I asked her about it, and she said nothing about smoking. I know that weed it’s nothing, but I can’t stand people that smoke something other of cigarettes. She feels bad about this situation. I love this girl, but what should I do now. Can someone else give me advice about it?",

    "selftext": "I called my girlfriend a curse word, and I feel really bad about it. Something happened that I wanted to share with her, but she kept talking about her own points. I had previously told her not to interrupt or raise her voice during our conversations, but she still does. I know this doesn't justify what I said, and I deeply regret it. I struggle to express my emotions and thoughts clearly when talking to her. After about a week, we met, and I brought her gifts, genuinely apologized, and gave her a letter explaining everything I was sorry for and the promises I made.\n\nShe mentioned that she almost fainted while coming home, and when I responded with, \"Damn,\" before continuing with, \"Are you okay? Where are you now?\" she held onto the first word and said I mocked her. I explained that I have never mocked her in our entire relationship or made fun of her in any way. Despite my apologies over calls and texts, she keeps bringing this up. Things had started to improve as we talked more comfortably, but she insists she doesn’t feel that I am truly sorry. I even cried while explaining how I felt and reassuring her.\n\nShe argues that saying \"damn\" is insensitive when someone is in pain, but I didn't mean it in the way she perceives. I tried to show concern by asking how she was doing and if she was okay, but she says those words don’t matter because of how I started the conversation. She insists that I mocked her with that single word. Recently, she was drunk and sent me many angry texts, telling me I haven't made it up to her or shown any progress.\n\nWe live far apart and are both preparing for exams, which adds more stress. She refuses to meet, and when I ask her what I should do to make things right, she just tells me that it’s my responsibility to figure it out. I’m not sure how to make amends or show her that I care. Please help me understand how I can improve the situation.",

    "selftext": "Hello there ! Just want to vent ! Maybe read some feedback if anybody has any advice for me..\n\nWe recently quit smoking weed due to health concerns so i feel like that’s something we used to do a lot together and it was our way of taking a moment and spending time with one another.. we also used to watch movies go out to eat a lot and just have fun but since he stop working during covid he hasn’t bothered getting a job and just been trying to make money with side hustles which has been such a hassle especially since we just had a baby last year and most of the financial responsibilities have fallen on me and it’s a lot of stress and pressure . On top of that we aren’t talking as much and all he does it go on his phone and watch anything and everything that has to do with crypto which is another issue cause it’s all he does all day and i can’t stand it !!!!!! It’s also all he talks about when talking to me. If it’s not crypto it’s about the president or conspiracy theories or the presidential election which i don’t mind but he didn’t even vote and he is constantly talking about how Kamala is a piece of shit. And me i just like to watch movies & im also on my phone watching videos or talking with my friends. I make it a priority to go out and have fun myself because he doesn’t take me anywhere …. And lately i just been feeling annoyed by him and i feel unhappy and a bit depressed because he tries to make me feel like the things i do are stupid and the movies i watch r a waste of time ?! Like wtf is his problem.  The only thing that makes us get along is when we are with our family during outings or just hanging out and drinking. Other than that when we r home we just cook sometimes and i feel miserable.. not sure what to do because i don’t want to end our relationship. I feel like when he was working we were great. We went on vacation we would go out to eat and just have fun together. I don’t see that anymore and i don’t see us fixing it. Not sure how to talk to him about how i feel can anybody help me ? \n31/M , 29/F",

    "selftext": "\nI’ve (22,F) been on 4 or 5 dates with a close friend of mine (24,M) but I’m not feeling it. I’ve known him for 3 years and we share several close mutual friends who may as well he family. I am extremely busy all the time as I work 2 part time jobs and go to school fulltime. I’m preparing to graduate college in a month. My last relationship lasted 4 years but ended quite badly and caused me to have trust issues. Last week I had cancelled plans on him since I got my period. He then asked me several times that night if I was sure I wasn’t up for it, if I was feeling better, etc. I found this disrespectful because I feel I shouldn’t have had to say No to him multiple times in the same night (I didn’t end up seeing him that night at all). The next day, he asked me how busy I was. I told him that I had an extremely busy day ahead of me (which is every day) and he continued to ask if he could come see me even after I made it clear I didn’t have time. He’s told our friends we are something, but I’m going to end it. My question is, how do I go about doing this? Do I invite him over and have the talk? I can’t go over to his place and do it because I’ve never been there. Should it be a phone call? I want to be as respectful to him as I possibly can!",

    "selftext": "I'm pretty sure we've both really fallen for each other and I know for certain that I've never felt this way about anyone. She's absolutely amazing and I really want to make her happy in every way (not just sexually).\n\nThe chemistry is really strong and I've not felt that before either. We have had long make out sessions and cuddle and hold each other all evening and night.\n\nWe moved onto being more sexual the other night and it was a bit of a surprise (it shouldn't have been as we were getting undressed but I was ready to take it in increments and just explore each others' bodies first).\n\nShe asked if I wanted sex and at first I was worried because I paused and she said we didn't have to but I said that yes I did.\n\nI immediately realised that I was completely soft as she took off my underwear and it didn't improve at all despite her trying to make things happen.\n\nI moved on to trying to pleasure her with my hand but she eventually removed my hand and I asked if she was ok. She said the sensation had changed and it wouldn't work.\n\nWe carried on just hugging and kissing.\n\nLater the same night we tried again but I still couldn't get hard and again I tried with my hand. I asked her this time to tell me what I could do to help. She said to go faster but in my nervous state I mistook that for faster and harder.... She told me that I was pressing too hard and it hurt and said that she can feel everything (she sounded a little annoyed) and I immediately felt awful that I'd hurt her.\n\nWe tried again a third time later in but the same situation happened and we just held each other kissed and slept.\n\nI apologised and admitted I must be more nervous than I'd realised and told her that I eventually want to learn her body.\n\nBut everything is soooo good with her and I'm now worried that this part of things isn't right. Although I am pretty inexperienced (I'm 40 and had one long relationship and a couple of shorter experiences) I've not had a situation where I've been completely soft and that I've actively given her discomfort :( (that part especially plays on my mind).\n\nUsually things have worked for both myself and my partner to various degrees.\n\nI know everyone is different but I'm also worried that this will have put her off despite me apologising and telling her I'd like to learn how to please her.\n\nShe did say that even if I wanted to wait 6 months for sex she wouldn't care. Which is very sweet but I can't help but assume that is mostly to make feel better.\n\nAnd now I've gotten into a bit of a spiral where I'm worried I'll make her sexually uncomfortable or not do things right and also that I'll be nervous when it comes to getting physically arroused myself and it'll keep happening.\n\nEverything else seems so perfect so maybe that's why I'm so nervous.... But I really don't want this to ruin things. And I really want her to really enjoy our physical time together.\n\nAny thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Throwaway because this is my first and probably only time ever posting on Reddit. I’ve used subreddits for a few years but never interacted with any before.\n\nSo me (18M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been dating for a good six months now. We started dating during our last month of high school and hit it off really well almost instantly.\n\nI’ve connected with her more than I have any other person I’ve ever known. She was my first serious girlfriend (first kiss and everything) while I was her fourth boyfriend (this will matter a little bit later).\n\nWe’ve been through our fair bit of relationship troubles, however nothing too major. And we’ve always resolved it. I know it’s still pretty early on in a relationship but I feel comfortable with saying that this relationship could go on for a pretty long time. We compliment each other well.\n\nHowever this morning I got some news I am not very happy about. I’d noticed she had been acting a little off since the previous night, and I decided to press her on it a little bit, before she admitted what was wrong.\n\nSo my girlfriend was in high school band, despite her being a year older than me she was in my grade level and we graduated together. Her younger brother is still in the schools marching band and they are all very involved in the community. Her three ex-boyfriends all did marching band as well.\n\nYesterday she and her family went to a band competition (I wasn’t able to make it). Her mom is good friends with her first ex-boyfriend’s parents, so they all sat together. I’m not worried about her first ex in the slightest (no offense but you know) so I didn’t mind.\n\nBut while she was at this competition she noticed her second ex (who is a senior this year in marching band), they sat sort of near each other. So fast-forward to this morning, she texted me this.\n\n“can you not break up with me and bear through this with me please?”\n\nI immediately was like woah, okay. What’s wrong? That’s a crazy thing to drop.\n\n“i think my feelings for [ex #2] are creeping back. and i really really am ignoring them. i saw him at the fucking competition yesterday. i didn’t talk to him or anything but my heart skipped a beat when i saw him. but i ignored him the rest of the time. normally that happens when i see someone i like, like you.”\n\nI was immediately like woah? Are you serious? She dated this guy for six months TWO YEARS AGO now, and he treated her like absolute shit. She’s dated me and another guy since then too. This worries me because last year (around the same time as this year) when she was dating her most recent ex, this also became an issue. She confessed to him that she thinks she still has feelings for [ex #2] in pretty much the same way as she did for me.\n\nLike I said, we’re a good couple. But we’ve definitely had our share of problems. Just a little over 3 weeks ago she called me worrying that she had completely lost feelings for me, assuring to me she still loves me, but that she doesn’t “like” me anymore. I distanced myself for a little bit but we worked through that completely, and she admitted she was acting super irrational. We were about THIS close to breaking up after that, but since I decided I would stick through and see if it got better (it did) we made it through that. And since then it’s been great.\n\nWell until today. I’m still trying to process all of this. She says she’s not going to do anything about these feelings, not going to talk to him, or anything like that. But she figured it would be better if I knew. I haven’t spoken to her since this happened (it’s been a few hours) and now I’m here asking for a little advice on how to keep moving forward. She says I’ve done nothing wrong to her, I’m the best boyfriend she’s had, I treat her amazing, the whole nine yards yet we keep having these sort of problems, completely on her end.\n\nShould I pull back a little more? Try to show her what she’s losing out on. I really just want to show her that I’m not guaranteed to be with her forever, since I’ve been clingy and too forgiving in the past, just in general.

    "selftext": "My boyfriend (22M) and I (21F) have been dating for 3 years now. I’m conflicted with our relationship because I feel like we are extremely different. He comes from money and I don’t. He gets the luxury of not working and receiving $1000 a month for expenses since he lives in his parents house. Which is still not enough because his car payment is $550 itself. So we struggle a lot to even be able to go on dates because what I make has to go into my expenses. I work part time and study. I’m usually the one paying for most things. He tries too, he’ll get in debt to please me but that’s not the issue. He goes to bed at 5/6am everyday. He’s spends the whole night playing video games. We have had so many arguments about this because I’m always up early (7/8am) and sleeping early as well (10pm). For so long he would wake up at 3/4/5pm and that would be the end of my day already. I felt like we would never talk because we had opposite sleeping schedules. He still does it, but because of extreme arguments he’s trying to wake up around 12. Emphasis on TRYING because apparently it’s a tough job and he can’t sometimes. He has failed 2 subjects in school because he hasn’t paid attention to them, but continues to play games and stay awake for hours and hours during the night. It bothers me so much. Is this normal? Am I overreacting? It just makes me feel so annoyed. ",

    "title": "Moving a complex situationship to platonic friendship. ",
    "selftext": "So need advice, encouragement and whatever else. I (33, f) have been in a on/off situationship/FWB for the past year with this guy (35,m) We are both neurodivergent, and get along ridiculously well on such deep levels. \n\nWe built up a pretty great sexual connection, but I would say our relationship was definately founded on a friendship During the first few months of dating, we hung out all the time, one evening about 3 months into dating he had asked me to be his girlfriend, which shocked me as he had initially told me he wasn't ready for a relationship and wanted it to be casual. He was drunk so I didn't take him too seriously, and we spoke about it the following week and he had admitted that he actually thinks its a bit too soon for that, and he was extremely sorry, that his feelings when he was drunk got the best of him, but he was still happy to see where it goes. 3 weeks later he meets up with me to tell me that he really cares for me, but he just feels like there's friendship vibes with us. \n\nI was shocked, and felt blindsided as I felt he had been the one intiating all the dates, and showing me so much love and affection just weeks before he put this on me. But we decided we would remain friends. I also chalked it up to him potentially being an avoidant, and knew myself, it was for the best. We have different lifestyles, he's a big drinker, doesn't look after his own mental health, and also does not want kids. Which I am undecided about. \n\nWe did remain friends, after a period of no contact, we always knew we would be back together, but just needed space for a while, and in 2 months we reconnected, and hung out alot, again. Like every weekend, we'd watch movies, and it eventually develop into something more than where his feelings grew deeper, and we'd be physically intimate. We went on holidays together, and I'd say for the most part, our day to day felt more like bestfriends, you know. Obviously there is the physical side to our relationship, but this was usually after a few drinks, and never really felt too romantic. \n\n He knew I was on the apps, and I knew he was, He has ADHD, so is easily addicted to porn, sex, dating, drugs, alcohol, any dopamine boosters essentially, and I know what he's like, he's constantly talking to girls.  So I was always telling myself this is casual, we are friends, and it didn't bother me. I'll preface this by also saying we have been having sex less and less, \n\nFast forward to the last 2 weeks, so we have spent a significant amount of time together, and he went to a wedding, he obviously got really upset about something, because he had completely reset his phone, and then turned up at my front door during what I'd call a mental break. He had taken a good amount of drugs, drank, and was feeling lots of guilt and shame around this and just cried for hours, telling me he doesn't feel safe anywhere but with me. His dad came to pick him up once he was feeling better. \n\nHe asked if i had plans on the Friday and I did, so we said we'd meet up on Saturday. I was out with my friends, when I bumped into him, and he was really drunk, I had asked where he had been for the night making conversation, and he said he had been on a date with a girl awkwardly, which I appreciate the honesty, but it felt quite raw I think considering it was infront of my friends and they didn't really know our situation. He then proceeded to tell everyone in his drunken state how I was his favourite person in the whole world and his main girl. \n\nHe came back to mine later that night, and was trying it on sexually, I said no. He respected my wishes, and then told me he loved me. (Again in a way that I felt was platonic) we spent all weekend together again like normal, watching movies, and we had taken a trip to my hometown where he met my mother for the first time. \n\nNow all week, I didn;t really hear much from him. We wouldn't be great at texting, but we'd share memes at least, as we're both busy and get overwhelmed easily. I was going to a gig that he would be at on Thursday and my friend pulled out, but he was there, so he said to tag along with him and his friend. I met up with him, things were fine, he was drunk though. And then maybe an hour later, he was upset about something and said he needed space, when I went outside a half an hour later, he was looking at his phone, he then hugged me and ran off, I followed him, and he got annoyed saying he didn't owe me anything because we didn't go to the gig together, and I asked if he was going to meet a girl, and he got very anxious and said I have to go. \n\nThe next morning he sent me a voice note apologising profusely, I needed time to process, so didn't respond. The next day he then sent me long messages saying how I am his bestfriend and he knows he upset me, and is very sorry that he left me to meet a girl he's interested in. And I felt more upset about just being left period, even if he was drunk. But equally it did sting to be abandoned like that for a girl he potentially likes, like being dropped now. \n\nWe had an honest conversation and I told him all my feelings, how I feel like the friendship is a bit onesided and how he can take advantage of how much I do for him, and that I'll be okay. I was really annoyed and still am to be honest that he did that, and he said he will do anything to prove that he will be a good friend to me. Now, I dont want to lose him as a friend, and we both said that we need to remove sex completely off the table, but I don't know how I can really move forward into a purely platonic friendship when I do have insecurities, particularly around why he always felt friendship vibes with me, but would still have sex with me. \n\nI will say that i do love him wholeheartedly, and I feel its the same way I love my other friends, but obviously there is the sexual connection between us, and I know a romantic relationship is completely off the cards. We didn't resolve what happened, I was just firm in that his actions needed to align with his words, if he loved and respected me he wouldn't ditch me to go meet up with a girl, especially given our past dynamic. I dont really know where to take it from here, I dont want to lose him, or cut him out completely, but I know things need to change. And I want to forgive him or at least give him a chance of proving he can be a good friend to me. He then sent me a list of all the reasons he loves me and said how disgusted he is that he hasn't been there for me. \n\nI suppose I am just confused as to what boundaries I can put in place for us, around our relationship, friendship, dating etc. What needs to happen for him to prove to me that his words aren't meaningless etc. He tells me all the time how much he adores me, how I'm his bestfriend, and I'm the only person he can be his real self around and how safe he feels with me etc. so I just want his words to align with his actions, but I don't know how. \n\nI know I need boundaries for myself for this friendship to work given it was a situationship, but how do I do that?\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m feeling quite lost and decided to come here for advice. Me (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for 5 months, but I feel like I lost feelings. For the first couple of weeks it was great. He was interested in me, would go out for a walk almost every day and I felt like he was really amazing. But after that, nothing really progressed. We started seeing each other less and less, because he has to be home by 8:30 pm, we really don’t go anywhere, for the last 5 months we have gone to 2 proper dates. He comes from a lower income family and I understand his struggles, but if he wanted to, we could have just gone to a cheaper place or split the bill, i don’t believe that a guy should be paying for me all the time. And the other thing - he told me that he loves me maybe 1 month after starting to date. I really like him, but I don’t think that I love him. And I feel like I am lying to him every time I say it back. He also bombards me with messages about how much he loves me, how he misses me and how he wants to be with me all the time. The problem with this is that this is the only thing he talks about. He doesn’t show any interest in my day, in my hobbies or interests, when I share something he just says: “Oh, that’s cool” and that’s about it. When I have something important coming up, he forgets it, when I want to plan something with him, he is always extremely passive and I end up planning everything. All of these things led me to losing attachment and feelings and I feel like the longer I wait to break up, the worse it will get. I’m just scared that I’m gonna hurt him and I don’t know how to approach the situation. If you could help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",

We’ve been together for close to 5 months now. This is truly the most amazing guy I’ve ever met. He’s so caring and just perfect to me in every way. I’ve met his parents and they always use the word love when talking about me and my bf. I can see the way he looks at me has changed (for the better) and all our relationship my friends have told me this man looks at me ”with heart eyes”. I love him and I’ve never been so sure I’ve loved someone. I’ve been kind of hinting at it but I don’t want to say it (I have bpd. I’m very bad at rejection) because I’m scared he won’t say it back. I asked him out first and initiated our first kiss and everything. (Mostly because he was scared he would push me away for ”moving too fast” and told me he wanted to play it safe) About a month ago I told him our ”firsts” will now be his to initiate and he agreed. \n\n\nI feel like after everything I tell him I add in my head ”I love you”. I tell him goodnight and quietly in my head I add ”I love you”. But sometimes it feels like he’s thinking the same thing but just not saying it. He’ll look at me with the most loving eyes and I’m like ok here we go and he’ll say ”how did i get so lucky?” which I think is absolutely lovely but I feel like I’ve known I (am going to) love him for pretty long now. \n\n\nThis isn’t something that makes me that upset. I think this is a very small problem to have compared to a lot of the posts I read on here. I’ve just been waiting and am wondering if I should wait or what should I do. The thought of saying it to him and not hearing it back absolutely terrifies me and at the same time even though I know it’s childish I feel like I’ve done all the first moves we’ve had and now it’s ”his time” to do it. \n",

If it's social friend then no problem. Force him to remove phone from closed friend might be seen as shitty but does not mean their should be some boundaries.   I have male friend and I always make sure to take step away when they have girlfriend and I like befriend the girlfriend for she doesn't feel apart and I generally sit with them and tell her she is not to be worry about me. Like even if bf might do weird thing drunk I would always push those guys away.  I would highly reprimand my friend to let his girlfriend away in that kind of event. As friend I would be the one calling him shiny to do such a thing to his gf. So best advise always befriend the girl. Surprisingly she might become your ally in many \"fights \".  The limit should be when you are rejected friendly. That mean it might be more then you think happened.",

If he still continues this behavior knowing that It makes you uncomfortable, then he clearly doesn't care about your feelings in the slightest. He says he's not concerned about you hanging with other guys, and as a fellow lad, I can tell you that's a flat out lie. You should be with someone who respects your boundaries.

I'm not advocating that you should, we (reddit) don't have enough information, but you deserve to be with someone you trust, who can communicate with you in healthy ways.\n\nMaybe start with that. Don't focus on the cheating stuff but try and bring up the communication problems and see if he's open to working on that stuff. Either with some self help books or couples therapy could be good places to begin.  Try not to get bogged down feeling insecure, as hard as that might be, it will just muddy the waters in terms of working through this stuff.  \n\nJust remember, everything is temporary, and worst case scenario, you've learned, grown, and are on your way to bigger, brighter things!",

Because I worry I'm not worthy of a good pertner, I worry I'll get used and set aside and forgotten.\n\nIt's making me want to go find a brick wall to beat my head on.

It’s just not fair of him to pursue me and then tell me all these things we would do and then just never do any of it. Then when I would ask him he says that he isn’t looking for anything and just wants to have fun. But it doesn’t add up because why would he have me in his life? Of course just to have as he pleases at his convenience. Still this just hurts because I wouldn’t want more if he wouldn’t have suggested it, he has misled me. He gets upset at me for wanting more, saying he can’t give it to me even though he suggested it in the first place. I would usually walk away in this situation, but I think I am in love with him. And all of these boundaries are only after I kept asking him more and more questions, he never said any of this at the beginning. I think I should talk to him, but what should I say?

She didn't consult me at all and I am angry about it and don't want people in my space for such reasons let alone the bedroom. \n\nThe brother seems honest and a decent person although I don't trust the entrance to my home to a person that can't abstain from Marijuana for 8 hours. \n\nI asked for her to get the key back rather sternly which I should have been more calm about and she won't budge. The conversation ended after a lot of displacement anger on her part.\n\nIf she can't agree that the key is for emergencies I feel I should leave after lease term. I really want this to work,  she's pretty amazing in most areas. I'm not trying to leave.

    "selftext": "My boyfriend (M19) and I (F19) have been together for eight months and recently we’ve been going through a bit of a rough patch. I know that relationships go through rough patches around 6 months but the problem might be more serious than little tiffs that usually happen around this time in a relationship. About a month ago I’ve notice my bf becoming less and less sexually active with me. I confronted him about it and asked if he was still attracted to me, he said he doesn’t know. He says he still loves me but he doesn’t know if the physical attraction is there anymore. We were both virgins going into the relationships and became sexual active after three months and it was great. I haven’t changed physically and neither has he so I’m not sure why there’s change in the relationship. I’m sure there’s nobody else in the picture, he’s not very social and allows me access to his phone (I’ve never gone through his phone but he has shown my his active chats before without me having to ask so there’s no concern there). He’s big into the gym and so he’s quite fit, however I’m kinda chubby, I’m not over weight but my tummy and arms have just a bit of pudge; I hike every week due to the college course I’m doing and I walk everywhere since I have no car, but I don’t go to the gym. He says he barely masturbates once a week and he prefers the sex to masturbation. However, he told me he kinda has to convince himself that he’s into it whenever we do have sex. He only started feeling this way about a month ago, before this he was very reciprocal to teasing and touching. He’s very transparent with me about everything and hasn’t confided in me about any physical insecurities. He’s worried that he’s falling out of love with me but he’s reassured me he doesn’t want to break up and that he loves me very much. It’s both our first relationship and I’m not sure how to navigate this. Any advice is appreciated. ",

He genuinely didn’t mean for it to be taken so horribly, I told him to be completely transparent even if it hurts me and he was hesitant still. He said he was really scared that he’s falling out of love or that the love was just puppy-love. He told me falling out of love and/or breaking up was the last thing he wants in the world because I’m “the most perfect girl in the world” for him (his words, genuinely) and he doesn’t want to lose me. Before this hurdle he has been the most affectionate and caring boy ever, we share the same humour and have similar interests so our conversations last for hours without a lull. He calls me beautiful and compliments me and my laugh and my humour and all every chance he gets, I return the compliments when I can (but due to my family history I struggle a bit with affection, he knows I try my best though). I don’t have many friends, if any. My relationship with my family is poorly. I’m even considering, as a second year college student, if college is even for me. Losing him on top of all this might shatter me. Break ups are hard enough as they are, but in my circumstances it might be even harder. If there is a chance of turning this rough patch around I wanna take it, I don’t wanna break up at the first sign of imperfection in the relationship. It’s only a very recent development that he’s been struggling with, he doesn’t even masturbate as much anymore, not even once a week (I’ve been with him for the last 10 days and we did the deed once on Tuesday, that’s it). So I’m thinking it just might be an internal thing he’s struggling with? It might not be him not being attracted to me anymore, as he’s said he has no idea what’s wrong. He’s desperate to fix it and return back to normal. He’s only a first year in college, engineering, so I’m thinking it could be stress related?",

    "title": "Am I (27M) projecting my insecurities/past onto my girlfriend (28F), or do I have a valid concern? ",
    "selftext": "I am really unsure how to approach my insecurities or if I have a valid concern. This is messy, so I’ll provide some context because I am not perfect nor shielded from criticism here…\n\nVery long post, but TLDR at the end. This is a burner account as well. \n\nMy girlfriend, for the sake of the story we’ll call Alexa, is a year older than me, and we have been dating since 2020, 4 years now. We met on Bumble, and from the first time we talked, met, kissed, have been nearly inseparable. Even in a pandemic, we did everything we wanted to and had a lot of fun, made memories, and set the foundation for a very healthy and loving relationship. \n\nPrior to this relationship, I was single for a few months after getting out of my very first relationship. It only lasted 4 months but I learned a lot during that time. When I met Alexa, she absolutely checked every box for what to look for in a friend and partner and opened me up as a person. I honestly never thought I could be loved the way she loves me. And vice versa, my heart is so full of love for her I can explode. It was an overwhelming and scary feeling, but we both felt like this was something special, and something to last a lifetime. \n\nFast forward 2 years, and we are still in a really good place. We have had some tough nights, as my lack of communication early on in our relationship was somewhat of a pain point in our relationship. I have never really had someone to lean on, nor be 100% honest with and because I didn’t communicate and would either make assumptions on things or not address issues that were bothering me. Other than a handful of some of those tough nights, we were still really loving and happy. \n\nOne of our goals for 2023 was to move in together — and we did! We moved in with Alexa’s best friend, and her best friends sister. To make a long story short — a month and a half into us moving in together, Alexa and her best friend have a really nasty falling out and the home environment became incredibly toxic. That was especially tough on Alexa because it was her first time on her own, as she has lived with her parents in the same home her entire life. She left her loving dog, and her supportive family to live with me and it went to shit so quickly. This was an excruciatingly tough emotional period for Alexa, but I was there at every step of the road. \n\nAlexa struggles with serious anxiety due to her job and other life events. She gags and throws up if she’s feeling anxious, she gets nauseous and loses her appetite among other things. She felt like a shell of herself, and because I made a promise to her parents to take care of her — I did the best that I could, and after the year lease was up, Alexa had expressed so much gratitude for my support during one of the toughest times in her life. \n\nThen I got caught with my fuck up. In May of this year, 2024, Alexa went through my phone and found pictures I had of other girls, and screenshots of tinder profiles I had taken. Over the better part of a year, I had been subscribed to OnlyFans accounts, sent explicit DM’s to content creators on Insta, and had created a tinder profile to swipe on girls. I cheated. I hold myself accountable for this. This not at all an excuse, just some additional context, but after the friend breakup between Alexa and her bestie, with all the stress and anxiety, naturally and understandably Alexa was not in the mood for sex for months and months. We went from, a few times a day, to a few times a week, to nothing for months. Again, not an excuse but for those wondering why I would go on OF.. I was just horny and made the WORST decisions of my life. Not asking for sympathy or anything bc I know it’s my mistake. \n\nWhile I never messaged someone I knew, never kissed anyone else, or slept with anyone else — Alexa had some cheating suspicions because of a (admittedly poorly handled) friendship I had with a woman coworker. We had resolved that suspicion, but Alexa had been cheated on in the past by her partner of nearly 8 years and had some past trauma from this experience. \n\nReasonably, after going through my phone, she exploded on me, broke up with me, and (to quickly note, bc of her anxiety effecting her so much, for the last 2 months of the lease she was living back with her parents until we found a new place together) asked me to take all of my belongings as the relationship was over. It was a brutal breakup. I knew I fucked up. I lost everything I loved and was almost certain it was over. I blindsided the woman I love in the most terrible awful way. I cried for days. It hurt the most because she told me I was her everything and that I provided everything she needed and to have the carpet pulled from under her was traumatizing. \n\nI travel a lot for work (and was being icky the most during these times), and was coming back home when Alexa surprised me with a visit. We talked, cried, and talked some more. We didn’t immediately get back together but through some seriously intense conversations she established some ground rules if we were to get together again. Of course I would do anything to be with her again. While the emotions were high, I was able to communicate my regret and remorse for everything I did. I had a plan in place to prove to her that a second chance wasn’t a waste. \n\nShe set some boundaries/rules though:\n“ 1.\tLimited interaction with the opposite sex, unless they are friends you had before our relationship. \n\t2.\tPasswords and access to each other’s phone. I feel like only checking your phone when I’m around gives you too much of an opportunity to hide/delete things. \n\t3.\tAny new followers; especially if they are women I would like to know who they are. \n\t4.\tDMing, messaging, and commenting with a female (any engagement) I’m not okay with. \n\t5.\tI need you to be true to your word, if you promise you’re going to do something I need you to do it. Not for me but for yourself. So if you said you were gonna stay home and write or go to the gym, but you were invited out, I need you to say no and show up for yourself.”\n\nOkay. I can do that. It’s a lot, but if I want the woman I love back — I’ll do anything. While normally some of these are extreme, and I think is unrealistic in the long term, I agreed to these terms. She also admitted she did not like demanding this, but if I were to earn her trust back, that was just what she needed that time. She said it was not long term, and as we both anticipated there were going to be triggers that cause some really tough conversations and it sure enough happened.\n\nI had promised when we got back together that I would limit my work travel because of our situation, as that was one thing she was super uncomfortable with when we were getting back together. Unfortunately I had 2 really important, and long, work trips that were booked for months.\n\nOne day I had been a little more unresponsive than normal (just very busy due to work) and grabbed some beers with coworkers, and forgot to provide some updates on what I was up to. This spurred a huge fight. Over the course of an extremely emotional conversation Alexa said “You know how shitty it feels to want to cheat just to hurt you? Or to feel regret in not cheating on your ass?” \n\nI think this line would hurt anyone in a relationship, and it hurt me badly. It still rings in my head months later, but is the only time she has ever said anything like this. It scared/scares me because as Alexa and I got to know each other and our pasts, we both had made a lot of mistakes in past relationships and had grown from them. As previously mentioned Alexa had been cheated on in the past, but she had also told me she had known it was going on for so long she became numb to it, and ended up hooking up with someone while still in the relationship. It was something she expressed regret for doing (as well as staying in the relationship), but it is now something I am thinking of. \n\nI can say that we are a happy and healthy couple, and I know that deep down — but I’m also aware we have some codependent issues and I’m working in therapy to get some help with this. That being said, the codependency and genuine insane love we have brings out some jealousy and craziness sometimes from both of us. \n\nOne of our issues since early on has been friends of the opposite sex. I have some really close friends who are women that I have known for years and have never even remotely been romantic. True friends that I stand by. Alexa, has always not had a lot of friends and usually really has 1 or 2 at any given time. She’s really close with her family however. But, when we first started dating, a male coworker of hers was making her lunches and before he quit the job shortly after, he got her a gift and wrote a card that said something like “I hope to see you again soon, in this life or the next.” She of course was open with me and shared it with me, but I was like “this is not a friend, he clearly likes you.” \n\nThis started a greater conversation about the double standards of men and women being friends and that it was unfair for me to have women friends and she couldn’t have male friends. I explained that while it’s possible for men and women to be friends, the way that her coworker was talking was not that. I trust her so I was like “I will let you handle that and if you feel like it gets weird I trust you to cut it off.” She agreed and eventually cut it off. \n\nFast forward back to now and now to the main point of my post. (Just to note; there’s still gonna be some context adding, so sorry it’s a long post.) \n\nDuring the convo she mentioned that line about “regretting not cheating” on me while I was on my work trip, she mentioned she was talking to an old friend (we’ll call him Dan), and this got a ruse outta me. I called her out for trying to make me jealous, and after a long convo she apologized. Dan had invited her to a concert and she had felt that pressure of wanting to go with a friend, but she had also had in the back of her head the things I had said about her last coworker not being a friend but actually someone who’s trying to get at her.  Apparently, Alexa and Dan have known each other from before Alexa and I started dating. \n\nA month or so after I stopped traveling — I got a suspicious feeling and decided to check Alexa’s phone and see that her and Dan have been talking. I can tell Alexa is texting with intent as to not say or prompt anything that would be considered as sus or cheating and I saw her attempts to keep it only friendly. However when Dan reaches out he said things like “thinking of you. Wishing you a beautiful week filled with nothing but the best feeling.” \n\nAnd then later after Alexa ignored a text for a week, she responds, and Dan says “it’s been a week, but this text is a worthwhile end to it. Always happy to hear from you. You’re always on my mind. I mean that in the purest and most real sense. I hope I can catch up with you sometime.” It was met with a friendly, not *really* sus, reply. \n\nI took pictures of the messages and after an anxiety attack, very poorly, in a “gotcha” manner tried to bring this up. She got livid that I would even bring this up the way I did given what I had done in the past. I know that I don’t have a strong leg to stand on, but I was really scared by this. She tried to reassure me that they are just friends. We had a relatively healthy and productive conversation but I was not able to get my main point out that “if any of my friends send those messages, you (Alexa) would freak out.” So I’ve been sitting on that for some time now. \n\nA few weeks have gone by and I haven’t really been giving this any thought, but Alexa and I were out yesterday and she went to share something on her phone, and could see that Dan was a recent contact on the phone. When we got back from our errands, I went through her messages and saw that they had been briefly talking earlier this week, but the conversation was prompted by Dan saying “you still have that DVD of mine.” Alexa said that she had it, and Dan replied with “you can keep it I just wanted an excuse to say Hi.” They had a few texts back and forth and ended the convo. \n\nThis line has sent me spiraling. My thoughts are racing. When did he give her the DVD? How long have they been talking (I assumed it had only been after we had broken up)? Like a codependent, insecure man like I am, I just went through her belongings and found the DVD. It was super dusty so I would have to assume it’s been anywhere from 3-6+ months ago.. which sorta matches up on the timeline but my gut is saying it was longer, and the alarms in my head are going off. \n\nSo the reason I am here is to ask — how can I bring this up to Alexa and not feel like because of my past I can’t bring up these suspicions.? I am very anxious and scared and kinda want to act out but know I can’t. \n\nI want to message Dan from Alexa’s phone to meet to drop off the DVD and confront him. Mostly just ask him to see if anything is happened and to politely ask to stop taking to her. Other terrible alternative is to wait for Alexa to come home and just have the DVD in hand. She doesn’t know I know about it and would obviously feel very put on the spot. I know both of these are terrible options, so I want to know how I should bring it up to Alexa. \n\nAlexa is the woman of my dreams, and I hurt her badly, it was the worst decision of my life. I am committed to her and getting this right, but how can I be sure to express my feelings without her feeling attacked, or that my opinion of concern is valid. \n\nEven with the essay, it’s hard to convey the nuances of everything in our relationship. Of course, I come to Reddit to get perspective on “the bad,” but I cannot convey the love her and I have for each other. She really is the one I wanna spend the rest of my life with but I know how I handle this situation will probably be the determining factor in our relationships future. \n\nWhat should I do next?\n\nTLDR: I emotionally cheated on my gf, and after getting back together have since been working on repairing our relationship. However I am suspicious of some sketchy behavior in regard to my gf taking to another guy. Because I cheated I don’t know how to bring this up because I may be projecting my own insecurities. ",

I Got really drunk and my girl friend (21F) asked if i could kiss with fangs on and i Said “i dont know” and she asked if we should try and i just Said yes. And after she Said she couldn’t feel the fangs. I did not realize what i was doing might not be right, cause when i was single i always kissed with my girl friends for fun. I am 100% straight and only into guys. I would never hurt my boyfriend (25M). But now when i woke up and regained memory i started to feel bad and wonder if what i did was not ok. I genuilly just did it cause I was curious of my fangs and I just didnt Think anything deeper from it. \nDont make me feel more bad i’d rather u not commenting than making me feel worse but I Want to know what u guys Think?",

Opportunities for harmless pleasures like this will always be within reach in our lives, but remember it’s only harmless if it truly doesn’t harm you or someone else. I think the anxiety it has caused is proof that it wasn’t harmless to you this time, even if it wasn’t morally wrong. \n\n  Use your words to talk your BF and see how he feels. You do have that obligation as partners not to keep secrets from one another. If you’re scared of him judging you for it, (which it sounds like you are) then there may some stuff he is still uncomfortable with in himself or maybe your core values systems don’t line up and that’s okay too! \n\n    Communication is key and being honest about this will do you so much good. It will either tell you, “my bf feels way different about this and I think our core value systems don’t line up” or it will tell you “wow, I told my bf and he didn’t judge me and made me feel seen and understood?” If that’s the case you guys have a real shot. \n\n    Whatever the case is, my final advice would be don’t ask for relationship advice on Reddit. People come here to mostly project their own conflicting feelings or self hatred on others. Keep loving yourself and follow the heart God have you. You’re beautiful and will get through this little interruption! \n\nTo the holier than thou crowd, OP asked for advice not admonishment. Think of any mistake you’ve made in your relationship, then put yourself in OP’s shoes and lighten the fuck up.",

Reposting as I missed off age and gender.\n\nAfter a recent rough patch in an almost 3 year relationship I've found out that my (F, 41) Boyfriend's (M,49) contact with an ex (F,47) has shifted and increased into something I'm uncomfortable with. \n\nI'm friends with my ex (M,44) he is friends with his. I text my ex maybe once every couple of weeks with either a check in, ask how our cat is or something along those lines. Until recently it was my understanding they had a similar dynamic. I occasionally meet my ex for a catch up, his lives further away so that wasn't really a thing. \n\nDuring a recent rough patch we took a step back (not a break up) and he visited family for a few weeks to help out at their business where his ex also works. This resulted in him seeing her every day and lead to him spending more time with her socially to, but also texting an uncomfortably large amount... Good morning texts, goodnight texts, texting for hours most of the day each day we were apart. Nothing overtly sexual, or flirty, but some slightly uncomfortable messages and lots of closeness like kisses, texts about how much they would miss each other and him after he returned home telling her \"I know it's not the same, but I'm still here\"\n\nIt's also obvious from the texts they had a lot of one on one time and emotional conversations. For example he talks about showing her is journal. \n\nI found this out by reading his texts messages, an act I'm aware is our of order and manipulative. I've apologized and taken accountability that my behavior was wrong, but before he knew I had read them he massively downplayed the amount of time they spent together and said he hardly text her at all. \n\nI'm aware my behavior hasn't been great in handling this. \n\nHe can't explain to me what this change in their dynamic means to him, nor can he understand why I'm uncomfortable with it. He sees it as my own anxiety (I do have anxiety amongst other things and I'm in therapy) He says \"I know the optics don't look great, but there's nothing in it\" and \"it was just nice spending time with her\" he gets frustrated and says \"I've explained it a thousand times, but you don't/aren't willing to hear it\"\n\nI feel stuck and the dynamic feels toxic for both of us. Any advice on moving forward, rebuilding trust, getting past this or ways to shift communication to a less reactive/defensive dynamic are greatly appreciated. \n\n",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: 1(22F) was cheated on by my fiance (25M) and I need help/ any advice on how to look past it or get over it. \n\nTo give some context before I begin I have been cheated on in the past. I know different people have different things as to what they consider cheating and a lot will disagree with me but I consider watching porn as a form of cheating, along with sexting others\n\nIt's a bit of a story so here we go. I (22F) just recently got engaged to my now fiancée (25M). We started dating June of 2022, around November of 2022 had found out that he had been sexting a girl he used to know during the beginning of our relationship, I had also found old pictures and videos of both his ex's on his laptop. When I had confronted him about these things at first he had tried to deny it but ultimately told me the truth. He said he promised it wouldn't happen again. Come May of 2023 I had caught him again, he had downloaded an app called Whisper and had paid multiple girls to send him pictures of themselves to him via Snapchat and through the whisper app itself (I didn't know he had a Snapchat). When I had told him I found out he admitted he had the app for a few months and he'd been sexting other girls and he had also watched porn. Before he and I had even begun dating I told him about what I had gone through in the past and what I wasn't comfortable with (the cheating in past relationships and how I wasn't ok with my partner watching porn). During this time I had also been sending him multiple pictures of myself and he'd always say how perfect I am. He apologized profusely and said he had to go back to my pictures because he couldn't get off to the other girls. I of course was heartbroken again and he promised me this time he'd be different. Fast forward to today he hasn't done anything that I know of and like I said before he recently proposed. I love him so much and I do want a life with him. What should I do moving forward and trusting him again and will he potentially ever cheat again?",

I have a problem with comments and actual potential contact with said naked ladies. I think it’s going too far especially since this happened once before.\n\nWe have two young kids both in school but under 7. I gained 30 pounds between the both of them but before we had them I was 105-120 pounds. I would always fluctuate from 130-150. Within this past year I was prescribed medicine that made me gain more weight and I am now 170 lbs. We have an active sex life I think but I don’t always accept his advances or make advances. My weight has my self esteem low. My boobs went from c cups to ddd cups but I have a bit of a tummy. I think my butt looks nicer with a little weight. I would like to go back down to 125-135 I’ve expressed I’m unhappy with my weight and trying to curb my diet and lower my medicines. \n\nI just don’t think it’s fair or respectful to try to come onto me and get angry when I say no.

    "selftext": "\nMy (M19) girlfriend(F19) and I are about to hit our one-year anniversary. On the surface, things seem fine, but I’ve been feeling insecure about where I stand with her.\n\nThe other day, I surprised her with a “Boo Basket” (Halloween-themed gift with treats and a card) She’d been stressed with dance team practices, school, and even a cold, so I wanted to cheer her up and show I care. That night, I took her to see Smile 2, and we ended up having a nice time.\n\nThe next morning, she asked, “What do you like most about me?” I answered quickly, telling her how her sense of humor brings me out of my shell and helps me relax. When I asked her the same question, she really struggled to respond. After thinking for a few minutes, she said she liked my “vibe” and appreciated my music taste and our “different perspectives.” This was unexpected since music is not something we’ve bonded over, and while I know we have different views on things, it rarely feels like she respects mine.\n\nFor example, she often calls me “woke” and has even made a weird comment about me being a “woke lightskin” (we’re both Black, but this comment was strange). She also tends to roll her eyes if I bring up social issues.\n\nShe ended by saying she does appreciate the sweet things I do, like the dates and the card, but I couldn’t help feeling weird about the whole conversation. She took several minutes to think of something nice to say, which felt off. My mind couldn’t help but go back to how easily she can talk about her celebrity crush, Chris Brown, and how “special” he is for 20 minutes straight. It’s been a point of insecurity for me, especially when she can’t seem to come up with what she loves about me as easily.\n\nLater, she also mentioned how our astrological signs (Gemini and Scorpio) aren’t compatible, which felt like another subtle dig at our relationship. \n\nI want to stress that I’m not a perfect partner by any means. I struggle with my own insecurities and communication, but these moments have me wondering if I should be more concerned. How do I move forward now with even more newfound insecurities within our relationship?\n\n\nTL;DR: I’ve (M19) been feeling insecure in my relationship, especially after my girlfriend(F19) struggled to say what she liked about me and only listed things she’s previously criticized. How do I move forward now with even more newfound insecurities within our relationship?",

(Details are better than a diagnosis.) \n\nYou're saying you're willing to work it out, so I'm assuming that nothing, so far, has been an absolute deal-breaker. \n\nYou say he doesn't listen to you when you express your feelings (i.e. you don't feel heard and he's not validating your feelings), that he avoids you (could be stonewalling, unless it's just over specific subjects), and blame shifts (probabably makes excuses and gets defensive). These things are not at all unsual, especially in younger relationships. They don't teach us how to manage relationships school, so it takes more education and practice to learn how to validate your partner's feelings, ask for space rather than stonewalling, and listen without getting defensive. \n\nI'd recommend figuring out a few things that you 100% need out of your marraige. Things that are deal-breakers if you don't get them. Bring these to him and try to stick to statements about how those things make YOU feel, and then ask specifically for what you need:\n\n\"When I share my feelings and you walk away, it makes me feel like you don't care. I really need you to try and listen and validate my feelings, even if you don't agree. I just need to feel heard. I know schools don't teach this stuff, so I'd like us to \\[see a therapist, read a book together, watch relationship videos, download an app for couples, etc.\\] so we can gradually work at getting better at communicating. You're such a great father, husband, and lover (injecting some humor) and 90% of our relationship is awesome! I just want to work on the remaining 10% so we can both be happier and model for our son/daughter what a healthy family looks like. I know you/I didn't have that, but we don't have to make the same mistakes our parents made. We're smart people (appeal to ego), and I think we can do better.\" \n\nIt's important to stroke his ego a bit, because soooo many guys feel like \"nothing I ever do is good enough!\" and so they stop trying. They have to know that SOME things they do ARE good enough. \n\nIf things tip too far in the negative, he'll be more tempted to just cut and run. Don't just focus on the negatives and complain about what he doesn't do. Tell him what he DOES do, what you appreciate, THEN what you need, and show him specifically HOW to meet that need. Men like to fix things, so don't be too general (e.g. \"Therapy twice a week until we get through this.\")  \n\nThen, ask him for what HE needs from you! (And maybe agree to work on his thing if he agrees to yours.) \n\nKeep it positive and light if you can. Maybe even joke about your problems if he has a good sense of humor. \n\nNothing you listed so far is an unsolvable issue, but you have to have some uncomfortable conversations if you want to move forward. \n\nGood luck!",

        "comment_body": "If your assessment is correct, and he is a covert narcissist, then staying is a really, really bad idea.\n\n\n  There isn't some magical formula to follow to appease them to happiness.  They don't do happy.  I know it feels like if only you did the right thing, this relationship would be perfect.\n\n\n  There is emotional manipulation that goes on in a relationship with a covert narcissist.  Conversations are not a medium to exchange information, conversations are battles to be won.\n\n\n  Something happened, some trauma.  Perhaps they were emotionally abused as a child, and torn to pieces.  To survive they protect that injury, that wound from all eyes.  They project an image of someone powerful, smart, successful.  They keep both hands on the steering wheel to drive all interactions away from that wound and to puff up the illusion they project.  You will hardly ever get any criticism to stick to them.  They will deny, deflect, redirect and attack, or bring up some past example of you, something you shared in confidence of you at your worst.  It was some regretful act you did, but they want to put that version of you, when you were your worst, in your head.\n\n\n  Because conversations are wars to protect that hidden trauma therapy rarely works with them.  It will take an almost herculean effort to have success.  Protecting that wound is such an unconscious thing that it's pure autopilot for them to eradicate all probing attempts.  Therapy requires that you actually want to get better.  Oh, they'll master the vocabulary and make it sound like they are getting better, but they are incredible at flipping the script and making themselves out to be the victim and you or anyone else as the covert narcissist.\n\n\n  As far as getting out, if you still have an emotional support system, be it friends or relatives, you may have to lean on them.  Depending on where you live there may be resources, like shelters you can go to that are secure.  It may not be safe for you to research these, if he tracks your online activity.\n\n\n  They tend to isolate their partner from friends and family so theirs is the only voice in your head.  It's much easier to manipulate and gaslight you, diminishing your self-esteem and causing you to rely on them more and more.\n\n\n  Ideally you leave.  When you do go no contact.  I know you want validation for everything he's done, validation for everything you feel.  He can't give you that.  His autopilot turns away any conversation that makes him accountable because that might penetrate the illusion and shine light on the wound.\n\n\n  You are valid for everything you feel.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  They are masters at emotional manipulation.  He read you perfectly, used his ability of illusion to create an incredible emotional connection when you first met.  He talked about what your lives together would look like and it was your ideal future.\n\n\n  But, things have come up.  Things that have made you have to prove yourself to yourself that you are worthy of that promised life together.  See, nobody sane would stay with these people if there wasn't promise of happiness, so, like a good salesman, they feed you a line about how great it could be, if only.....\n\n\n  Anyway, go completely no contact.  Block your number, all social platforms, and if they make contact do not engage.  They'll appear to have changed, they'll say all the right things, or maybe they'll threaten self harm if you don't come back to guilt you into feeling responsible.  Emotional manipulation.  Boy, are they good at this stuff.  They can fill your head with lies, they can trick your heart so it soars.  But they can't fool your gut.  Your gut will penetrate through the lies and sweet talk and detect the malice underneath.  You gut always knows.  It's just your head and heart aren't used to being deceived and don't really fathom believing what your gut has said this whole time.  Trust your gut.\n\n\n  He may send other friends family after you, to suck you back in.  Again, emotional manipulation.  These people may have the best intentions, it's just he's been busy ruining your reputation, so to these people, he's the victim and you are the villain of the story. So you may feel compelled to engage to salvage your reputation.  Again, just more emotional manipulation-he's pulling at whatever string he has to to get you to engage, to dare to converse, where he'll talk you in circles for 5 hours just manipulating you more and more.  Conversing just leads to more training.\n\n\n  I hope something here helps.  Again, so sorry.  Stay safe, be smart.  Good luck!!",

I have abandonment issues and fears, and lately I have been learning how to cope with my emotions. First, before I start to panic about something, I try to talk to my fiancé about how I’m feeling and what I’m thinking about. \n\nAlso, remember that usually the negative thoughts you have are not your own. It’s not unusual for abusive families to pretty much brainwash you into thinking the way they want you to think, because that’s how they gain power and control over you. For me, I have to tell myself that these thoughts are not my own- they are the thoughts created by my past situation and they’re more like the thoughts of those people that wanted control over me. So I try to let those thoughts go. \n\nI also try to let go of these thoughts because  I’m scared of being abandoned. If my fiancé was going to abandon me, then he wouldn’t have proposed to me or probably stay with me for this long. I’ve told him about my past and I also try to keep a VERY open line of communication. I tell him about things that happen to me, the good, bad, funny, etc. when I don’t feel good, I tell him. I talk to him about these things because I also know him and trust him enough to know that his way of thinking is a lot more logical and rational than my own and he knows how to talk me through things and keep me calm. \n\nIt’s for sure not easy coming out of survival mode like that. I 100% know that if he were to leave me I’m in the same boat, no family, my friends are busy, so he’s all I’ve got. But I have had to learn to trust in my path, and that’s not an easy thing to do. \n\nI hope this helps you",

Because from what I understood it seemed like you asked him if he's ever going to be attached to someone like you in the future? As in, would he ever fall in love again if you broke up? Is that what you meant? Or in the sense that he might get attached to another person someday, meaning fall in love with someone else while he's in relationship with you?\n\nI can't seem to really get it, as you didn't really give a lot of details. Anyhow, I can get why his response can trigger your insecurities, as it's very vague. I guess you expected a response that would show his willingness to keep the bond with you no matter what. That makes sense in a relationship that is so far developed (you living together and all that) so I 100% get it why you would feel a bit betrayed by his answer. When you have future plans with someone you need some sort of confidence that they will stick by until the end. When the answers are vague, it's normal to feel like your confidence is crushed.\n\nAnyway, I'd suggest you stop posting here, it's full of numbnuts and armchair psychologists. Just ask chatgpt for an opinion, it will be 10 times better than asking people here, as they often give toxic advice. For example, them calling you \"overreacting\" is such a toxic term to use. Just cause they don't understand what you feel doesn't mean what you feel is invalid or should be brushed off.",

Partner has bad anxiety. Partner hates waiting and has little to no patience when it comes to waiting for me to do anything. I think its a familial trait. Partners brother is the same. So i was trying to figure out how to tie it so it didnt fall off and what kind of knot to use. I looked up to see that look on partners face and said \"you don't want to wait for me to figure out the knot do you?\" Or something pretty similar. My intent was to gauge whether i had time to get it right or just do a couple shitty overhand knots and hope for the best. Partner got way upset immediatly after i asked the question and claims i was being passive aggressive. They had a horrible education where very little formal academics were taught. Now when i went to school i was taught in english class that was a normal way of asking a question, but they seem to think it isn't. I think it may be generational or a lack of education due to the fact nobody else has ever claimed im passive aggressive as often as my partner, usually about similar types of speech. In this case they say if i had asked \"do you want to wait\" rather than saying it backwards, it wouldnt be passive aggressive. Also partner is autistic if that helps. I dont care about being right, i just want to u derstand the disconnect so i can stop fighting with them because it seems every time i try to fix these things by doing what i think they are telling me i upset them again.",

My wife and I live in a Bible Belt state and both grew up in traditional conservative households. We both voted for Biden in 2020 against what our families wanted us to do.  \nHowever, this year she has decided to vote for Trump. She, as many people, says that her reason is \"the economy\". Now I'm not here to shame her for the way she is voting. I have done my research and come to my conclusions and I trust and hope that independently she has done her research.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons policy wise why I'm voting for Kamala, and on top of that there are a ton of personal reasons as well. I am struggling with the fact that my wife is okay voting for someone like Trump.\n\nI respect my wife as her own person and obviously she can make her own decisions on who to support. I am just not sure how to navigate this situation because I can't talk to the one person I love the most about things that really matter to me.\n\nI guess my question is looking for advice on how to move forward especially with Election Day coming up so soon. I've already decided that I'm not going to force my POV on her but it's just difficult when I hear her repeating rhetoric that I feel is just harmful and inaccurate.",

No one owes you an explanation for having a past, because I doubt this is your first relationship. It's poison and will on bring you pain. \n\nJudgement: Again, be reeeeeeally careful with this. Youre allowed to be upset that she lied to you. You're allowed to be upset about her very graphically sharing intimate details about other partners. But you have to remember that romantic relationships are very challenging when you're young. I was involved in things in relationships in my early 20s that I would have shut down immediately when I was older. You try stuff, it doesn't make you feel good, you don't do it again. That's normal. \n\nMake sure that your feelings on this are grounded in who she is, and what is contained within your actual relationship. She owes you an explanation on the lying and the shaming of partners, and I would also have some hard questions about what she's said about me to other people if I were you. But make sure that's where your coming from, rather than a place of jealousy. Talk to her, ask for complete honesty, and listen. That conversation could break you up or put you in a better place, but it needs to be discussed.",

Do you believe people's values change over time? If so, is it possible that her values back then aren't the same as her values now?\n\nI know for sure my values aren't the same as they were in college. My values have evolved with every year I've been alive.\n\n>shes been nothing but loving and respectful to me (that i know of) throughout out relationship  \n\n\n>i love her\n\nNow let's talk about these two statements. You love her and you feel loved by her. I think the other commenter pointed out very accurately that what you're feeling right now is jealousy. I get it. If I found a detailed history of my fiance's past partners I'd be pretty upset about it. Not upset at her, of course, it's just natural that you don't want to think about your current partner with other people.\n\nThe way you're feeling is normal. But I think you're misinterpreting that feeling as her doing something wrong. The only thing I think you have a legitimate grievance for is her being dishonest about how many partners she's had in the past. Not because I think the number of partners really matters, and I don't think you should care either. But because honesty is important.\n\nSo now the question you're left with is this... do you honestly care enough about all of that to lose this relationship? If this is enough to get you truly upset, you need to know you may irreparably ruin your relationship.",
