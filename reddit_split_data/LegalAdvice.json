    "selftext": "Approximately one month ago, I sold my vehicle to a person claiming to be a used car dealer, who had a fake office setup and fraudulent dealer plates. He provided me with a check, which I later discovered was counterfeit. Upon realizing this, I contacted the police, filed a report, and reported the vehicle as stolen. The vehicle was subsequently recovered two weeks later from another individual’s driveway, who claimed to have purchased it from the same fraudulent dealer and now believes he is the rightful owner.\n\nThe police retrieved the vehicle and returned it to me. However, the individual who unknowingly purchased the vehicle continues to threaten legal action, demanding that I compensate him for his loss, or he will take me to criminal court. What steps should I take at this point to protect myself?\n\nHe has my old vehicle title certificate ( I replaced the title certificate right after this happened), he tried to say I scammed him by selling him a vehicle and take it back.\n\n(Note: The scammer has been apprehended but was released with only a misdemeanor charge.)",

This is for people who don’t make a lot of money or are homeless. Submit the paperwork they ask for, and answer their questions. Your bill will likely be zeroed out and written off once you’re approved.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, try #2.\n\n (2) ask for an itemized bill and a reduction. They know you have no insurance, and truthfully aren’t expecting to get paid. I would tell them what you realistically can offer in writing.\n\nI’d say max offer 20% ($1600), and have them agree to a payment plan of $67 a month for 2 years. \n\nHave them approve the request with a signature before paying absolutely anything. Then start making small payments toward that goal. \n\nThis is riskier, as if you default they will automatically go to #3.\n\n(3) Let the bill charge off to collections and wreck your credit for 7-ish years. \n\nI went this road and it sucked. Took years to fix my credit, a lot of settlement requests, and calls from creditors that don’t talk to each other.",

    "selftext": "Background: Me and exh have been separated for almost 4 years. Our co-parenting relationship was non-existent the first 2 years of our separation (before he met his now wife). Eventually it got better and we finally could be in the same place (I mean for our child's events) without anger. I actually credit my exh's father for this- his father forced us to eat dinner together (by this time exh was already dating his now wife) and do other things together. Eventually we were having dinners as one big family (me, exh, his wife, our child and her kids) from time to time and doing other stuff together too. Earlier this spring, it really seemed like everything was finally in the past and everything was pretty good. Her oldest kid even spent the night at my house on several occasions and I even took him out of state once on a trip with my kid.\n\nThen his now wife nuked everything out of nowhere. She called CPS on me with a bunch of false claims (case was closed). When that did not go her way she tried for a restraining order. That also was denied too. The judge laid into her for wasting his time.\n\nI have repeatedly told both my ex-husband and her to leave me alone. I want absolutely nothing to do with her after what she put me through. The last message I sent directed to her was to leave me alone back in late June. Now, she will not leave me alone. I had to block her on everything. She sends me unsolicited messages (she did before as well but these ones are mean every single time now), she follows me around in her car (I had to buy a dash cam because of this) and now, she is pissed that I will \\*not\\* spend time with her so that all the kids can be together during my parenting time. Make it make sense!\n\nWhat can I do? I was told by 2 different lawyers that it's not a good idea for me to file a restraining order against her because it would make it seem like I'm only doing so in retaliation and since the one she filed was denied, there isn't anything there (aka no violence). However, she refuses to leave me the hell alone. She got her wish in that I will not be around her but now she is pissed that I refuse to be around her...literally everything I do is wrong in her eyes.\n\nI am at a loss here. Should I file one since she will not leave me alone? If so, under what grounds so that it sticks? Please help. \n\nETA- in Florida.",

        "comment_body": "I would take some steps before asking for a restraining order; you may be able to resolve the issue. If not, you will have a better foundation on which you can request a restraining order. \n\nMy first step would be to address this separately with your ex-husband. Is there a way that you can safely meet with him in person (if you do it over the phone, his wife will likely be listening and giving her input)? You could explain what is happening and come up with a solution. After you meet, send him a text in writing documenting what you discussed and any solutions you agreed to (this can be used later if necessary). If you are not able to come to an agreement, also document that.\n\nThe next step would be to go to the police. Having a police report will help greatly if you eventually request a restraining order. The police will document the harassment (is she calling you multiple times, is she texting you, is she messaging you on other platforms, is she changing her number or contacting you through multiple accounts, etc.). You can also have the police document the fact that she is following you, and has filed false CPS claims and failed restraining order. You need to have all of your information organized first, including printouts of any harassing messages, any court rulings, any CPS documentation, and a log of dates/times/places where she has been following you (if you don’t have that, start now). The police can advise you if any of her actions arise to the level of criminal charges, and they may have other recommendations for you. Hopefully, they will also conduct some investigation (such as an interview) involving the wife, which will also be documented in the report. This would help you because the involvement of the police may prompt her to end the harassment. Also, the police report would document any potential defenses or explanations the wife has, which will also help you. \n\nOnce you have notified the police and have the police report, you can reassess. Did the police involvement help you at all? Were the police able to charge her with anything? Did the police conduct an investigation and warn her that her behavior could lead to criminal charges? If you are still experiencing the same level harassment, then you can file for a restraining order (which is a criminal proceeding) or potentially you could also file a civil claim for harassment (this will require you to pay for a lawyer). \n\nWhichever route you take, it is very important that you document everything. You must print out any physical records, and you must keep your own records for other significant events so that you are not trying to rely on your recollection alone.",

    "selftext": "I lost my passport a couple days back in London. Yesterday, I saw a sign at our local DLR/train station saying “Passport found, please leave you contact details below”. I left my phone number and the next day (today) I get a text saying “Hi, I found your passport”. He sends me pictures to verify and I think “Great, going to get it back smoothly”.\n\nHere’s where he starts acting funny:\n\n-First states that he has friends who were willing to pay him 1000 pounds for him to sell that passport to them.\n\n-Then says “Pay me 500 and i will give it to you tomorrow”.\n\n-After I say no I’m not paying 500, I can at the most pay 200, he starts saying “oh 200 is nothing, I will think about it. Maybe I will leave it at the police station and you can pick it up from there or maybe I will give it to my friend for 1000”.\n\n-At this point I’m like wtf. He also starts deleting some messages but I’ve screenshotted a few before he did. I called him again and he keeps now saying that he will give it on Saturday to the police and send me a proof pic so I can pick it up. He keeps saying he can’t give it today because he’s busy.\n\n-At this point I did a quick search and found his facebook profile with his full name and public account. I also have his phone number and pictures (from FB). \n\nI have reported it to Met police and they’ve given me a CAD number and said someone should contact you soon but I’ve received no calls yet. I don’t know what else I could do/say to this guy to get him to return it to me today.\n\n ",

They supposedly overpaid me $18k in 20 months, now they are giving me only these two repayment options: 1- pay the full amount at once 2- pay the full amount in 4 payments....

They are trying to get it back as quickly as possible, probably due to company finishing out the fiscal year. Just tell them that you can't do those terms, you can only handle Y terms right now. \n\nIf you do have your plan docs etc outlining how the payments should happen, I would definitely review them. Ask to sit down with the sales commission team to review the payments for each month. If they screwed up this badly, they should give you the benefit of a sit down and a walk-through of the errors/issues. You should be able to compare their statements with your payroll records -- commission should be a separate line item on your payroll statements.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago my father died of cancer that had metastasized in his lungs - which I assume means that it was cancer that started somewhere else but it was what it did to his lungs that killed him.\n\nHe was 86 at the time of his death. He was very active, even in his 80s, and in great shape mentally and physically. This is a guy who would push mow his 3 acres of land. He never sat still. For about a year prior to his death, he had developed a cough that was persistent and racking. It kept him from sleeping well and he had to stop doing certain things, like going to church/teaching Sunday school, because it was disruptive.\n\nHe went to his primary doctor often and they told him that there was nothing wrong with him and that \"old men cough.\" This was relayed to me and other family members when we asked what the doctor had told him. A couple of weeks before his death he had rapid weight loss. I visited him and was astonished at how skeletal he looked. He complained that his chest hurt. We went to the ER immediately.\n\nAt the ER, the doctor told me that due to his advanced cancer it was unlikely he would live out the week. Then the doctor was shocked to find out that none of us knew he had cancer. He had been going to the doctor often - like monthly - how could it have been missed? My father died about a week later.\n\nI know my father visited his primary doctor many times over the last year of his life. He told me of the conversations he had with his doctor that nothing could be found to be causing his cough. Did they miss something that should have been obvious? Do I have a case for wrongful or negligent death or something similar? Or should I just let it go?\n\nThe reason I'm considering this now, a year after his death, is that my mother died two weeks ago. She declined rapidly over the last year without the love of her life who was her high school sweetheart. I feel like I lost two people over one mistake. I know they were in their 80s, but they were both active and seemingly healthy right up until my father suddenly wasn't. Anyway, any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the advice. I do appreciate it. ",

It takes a profound, criminal amount of \"bad behavior\" to roust a tenant from their home.  Those rights of tenancy are important and don't just erase on an allegation.  Or a moderate amount of bad behavior.  \"You're having another episode,\" is a *terrible* thing to say to someone who struggles with something like bipolar disorder.  But probably doesn't rise to the kind of thing a judge is going to issue an order around.  \n\n2. We still have room to argue the behavior itself (which was really my point).  Maybe OP really *was* having an episode.  Maybe her tenant really was trying to say \"the way you're treating me in this moment isn't reasonable because you're struggling.\"  I don't think that's probably true because this is reddit and we grant our OPs an odd sort of fiat power in their discussions.  But the court doesn't.  The court will consider that both sides may be true and both sides need to be argued.  \n\n>It is still important to follow the standard process to prevent them from coming back when it expires.\n\nThis is a core point.  Document or don't document.  Apply for an order or don't apply.  But at least don't lose sight of or progress toward an eviction on the overstay.  That's the argument we know works.",

In the last Hurricane, her new roof blew off again.  In the paper work/invoice she received from the roofer, it says that the roof is WARRANTY up to 160mph winds and the roof meets all Florida Hurricane codes and specification.   In the small print on the back of the invoice, it says it is not warranty against hurricanes and tornados.  This seems very misleading and I don't know when you will get 160mph winds when it is not a hurricane or tornado. Do we have any legal recourse here?",

Now the property owner is telling me that I have to completely take out the concrete footing and return the area to it's original state. The building was there for at least 20-30 years before I tore it down and the property owner actually gave the person I purchased the house from permission to put it there in the first place.

    "selftext": "\nI moved in to my apartment 6 months ago in Los Angeles, CA and recently my gas heating appliance started leaking gas so SoCal gas shut it off. My landlord was able to at least get me gas for my stove but for my heating it’s beyond repair. They had some people come out and look at it for a quote and said in the meantime they will by me space heaters. Now, two months after it was shut off the weather is getting colder and my apartment leaks air like crazy making it hard to keep heating it with space heaters. I contacted the management company and they said that gas appliance is beyond repair and will not be replaced. I mentioned it would have to be done either way because if I move they cannot rent it to another new tenant as heating appliance is legally required. They state:\n\n“Heat is a legal requirement, but not the method in which the heat is provided. Gas heat is not a requirement and electric space heaters satisfy all legal requirements. The landlord does not ever plan to repair this heater and we discussed renting the unit in the future with space heaters provided. We have done this many times.”\n\nI’ve looked online but cannot find if they can or cannot legally just replace my heat with space heaters. To be real, who wants that. And on top of it when I turn my microwave on it short circuits the electricity and shuts off. It’s only November and the next few months are going to be freezing ..\n\nIf you have sources or links backing your comments up that would help a lot too!",

Failure to provide adequate heating could constitute a violation of this requirement, which could result in legal consequences for the landlord.\n\nWhether space heaters qualifies or not, is kind of debatable - and having them as primary heat source likely violates code compliance in some capacity…\n\nSpace heaters can consume up to 43% more energy to achieve the same result.

Having space heaters generally do not meet the requirements of keeping habitable rooms at 70 degrees: space heaters should be turned off while unattended for proper use according to their manuals. Which means any room you are not in will revert to colder than 70 degree temperature.\n\nAdditionally, not maintaining the heating system will generally be considered a breach of the lease. The heating system that’s broke is what was included with your lease, not space heaters.\n\nAlso you’ll pay about $40 a month for one (1) 1000w space heater (assuming you do turn it off) you’ll see an absurd increase in utility costs. In CA you can deduct that increase from your rent until they do fix the heating system.\n\nAs for the landlord, I’m kind of shocked they aren’t worried what the plumbing will do if not maintaining sufficient heat in the rental. Around where I live, the pipes would freeze and burst leading to a massive repair bill. Obviously LA isn’t likely to get snow but weather has been all over the place in the United States during the last couple of years so it’s not out of the realm of possibility.",

I’ve been flying my Mavic 3 Pro from my backyard, fully registered and under Part 107 regulations (I work with the FAA, in fact I work in air traffic ops). Yesterday, out of nowhere, my neighbor, who I’ve never interacted with before, started yelling at me from their side of the fence. They were completely irate, shouting obscenities, calling me a “pedophile,” telling me to “get a hobby,” and saying I was a “creep.” It was bizarre and pretty unsettling, especially with my kids around... I mean, part of it was even almost comical it was so out of nowhere.\n\nI tried to calm things down by inviting them to talk and even offered the contact info for the local FSDO if they wanted to report me. But instead, they escalated it and called the police... \n\nWhen the officers arrived, I immediately said... Let me guess, it's about the drone? They both kind of rolled their eyes and said.. yes. I explained everything in detail and laid out all the regulations I was following. They were VERY supportive and reassured me I wasn’t doing anything wrong. I also work part-time for the local DOT and I asked them for the local police report number/complaint number ID which he happily provided. It was actually a very pleasant and uneventful meeting with the cops, but nevertheless one could understand why this is a bit disturbing. \n\nFor context, I’ve never flown towards their house intentionally—ever. I have probably overflown it a few times over the months, but not anything intentional and I've never once had any desire to have anything to do with that property, that's not why I fly my drone. I am almost always at 400 feet (AGL) with proper LAANC clearance within a busy class C airspace inner ring. Frankly I just don't care.\n\nTo be a little bit blunt about it, I'm quite literally a professional, subject matter expert of the FAA National Airspace System. You can get mad, that's fine - but I know what I'm doing. \n\nI always take off over the tree line and head straight to a county park about a quarter mile away, staying within a clear line of sight through my tree line. So honestly, I’m more confused than anything… in fact it almost makes me wonder, what the hell are they hiding over there? But, like I said earlier, I don't really care.\n\nI guess I’ll just keep flying and try to ignore it, but I can’t help feeling uneasy about the whole thing. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I should add that I've been flying for months and this is the first time I have ever, ever had anybody react negatively to my drone in my face.\n\nIs there any broad recommendations as to how to handle this? Obviously, finding another spot to fly might be the best option, but I should have the right to fly in my own backyard without being harassed if I'm following all regulations.\n\nThanks! \n\n\nThe one cop said it best, \"some people just freak out at new technology.\" indeed.

Just fly vertically high up enough so you aren’t being a chode with the thing at low heights, or take a different route altogether OR take your drone somewhere else that isn’t so intrusive. I know you think they’re cool toys, but I don’t think you realize how absolutely fucking obnoxious they are, especially when at lower altitudes.\n\n\nAlso, the smart and polite thing to do would have been to have communicated with your neighbours directly BEFORE flying. Knock on their doors. Be friendly. Say, “hey I just wanted to let you know I’m planning on flying my drone over in this area from time to time.. please let me know if you have any concerns”.",

        "comment_body": "sUAS pilot, instrument rated pilot, aircraft dispatcher, and all around UAS knowledgeable here. There are layers to this situation and laws you must follow. The FAA's aren't the only rules out there. \n\nFederal: Mavics must be registered through DZ. You must have a 107 certificate to operate under 107. This we know and you have established such. Also be sure you have your airspace authorization if required. Abide by the operations over people requirements and other federal law. \n\nState: NY has requirements about flying for commerce. So if you're using the drone for business, be sure you have the proper registration and licensing. \n\nLocal: some local counties have additional restrictions on drone flying, typically under the parks and recreation board. They sometimes have weight limits and permit requirements for any kind of operation (recreation or commercial). Most drone restrictions come from ingress and egress of the drone. Some localities do not allow you to take off nor land on certain property. \n\nSo if you follow all of the above laws and regulatory requirements, you should be Golden. I've had the cops called on me twice. It happens. People don't like that drones are flying so close to them despite being down in a safe and legal manner. If you're worried your neighbor will call the cops again, then see if you're allowed to fly at the parks you mentioned. Otherwise, your neighbor will eventually get the reputation that makes us pilots add in a waypoint into ForeFlight that just says \"dickhead.\" \n\nGood luck!!",

My father has the same name as me (we have different middle names) and has never lived at my address (I bought my house 4 years ago). I was 17 years old when the first of many Tax Amount Assessment on this form was dated. I never had any ownership stake in his business and I have never lived in NY and still don't. I hired an attorney to send them a letter and they never responded to it and kept sending me the collection letters. Then I called the NY State Division of Taxation and Finance about a year ago to try to clear it up with them. They understood that it wasn't my debt and stopped sending me letters until yesterday I got one stating \"This is in reply to your recent inquiry about the above assessment: No evidence was provided to show that (MY NAME) is not responsible person of (BUSINESS NAME) and therefore not responsible for the use tax liability.\" \n\nI just called NY State Division of Taxation and Finance again and recorded the name and ID# of the individual I spoke with. I explained the situation to him and he asked for my social security number and DOB and looked me up and saw that I owe $0. He said he is sending me a \"wrong party letter\" which he says will have the NY State Division of Taxation and Finance letterhead on it and will say that I (my name and middle initial) am not the party responsible for my father's debt. He said however that he cannot change the address on the account because it is me calling and not my father. He said he will speak to his supervisor about somehow stopping the letters (I have heard this before). I am obviously concerned about having letters sent to my house about a 7 figure debt that I do not owe and even more concerned about the prospects of liens on my property or garnishing my wages or bank accounts.  They of course tried to get as much information about my father as they can but (A.) I don't have much, and (B.) I don't feel its my job to find him for them. \n\nAm I at any real risk of wage garnishments, bank account levies, or property liens? Is this \"wrong party letter\" enough? I am not a resident of NY and never have been, nor do I work there. Any other advice?  I appreciate any help. Thanks.",

In the document given to us it stated if we disagreed we could terminate the lease. We gave our 60 days notice.\n\nThe landlord then pushed back a bit. Afterwards we contacted a lawyer for a consultation and she said that was a breach in lease and we were good to proceed with the 60 days notice. We informed the landlord that we were sticking with the 60 days notice.\n\nWe found a new place and signed a lease starting the same day as our 60 notice is up.\n\nThe landlord is now pushing back saying that the increase has been voided and there was no breach due to the rent never actually increasing.\n\nThe problem is now we have already signed a new lease and we had already given our 60 days notice.\n\nMy questions are as follows.\n\n1 Is that actually how it works? Can the landlord back peddle and have everything be good?\n\n2 Other than talk to the lawyer what would be our next steps?\n\nWe are currently waiting on a phone call from the lawyers office, i just want to know what to expect.",

    "title": "How do I quickly remove an adult family member from my home (FL) ",
    "selftext": "\nHello, Im 17 and have been dealing with my sister (She is around 30 years old) for a while now. She has done a variety of things ranging from strangling my mom, destroying things around the house, biting my mom, death/harm threats to me and my mom, and general text harassment. I try to avoid her so she doesn’t do much to me besides texting repeatedly to insult me. Sometimes she will also try to push me or yell at me if I’m near her when shes mad but thats about it \n\nShe isn’t always like this so I haven’t been doing anything until this year since she has been more aggressive lately after a long period of not physically harming anyone (last time she majorly physically harmed my mom before the biting was at least 6-8 months ago. Besides that she has only been texting stuff really). She acts somewhat normal until some sort of event triggers her\n\nToday I assume it was her car not starting and my mom saying she wish she could give me a ride to school since ive been walking everyday (which my sister sees as my mom favoring me, which I agree she shouldn’t do but I wish she wouldn’t take it out on me) Usually I would just hide out in my room until she calms down but recently I had to call the police on her since she was biting my mom and attempted to lay hands on me and my boyfriend. She was arrested but my mom just bailed her out as soon as she could. My boyfriend also just left for a work trip which I assume is another factor to her only now harassing us, when my dad was in the picture and my moms bf was here she was never this bad\n\nMe calling the police was the first time I have ever done anything directly to her so Im worried when I get home she will try to harm me or even my pets. She has also been talking about hurting us with a gun but she has never actually used a weapon on us. When she gets like this it also makes it hard for me to focus and get a good nights sleep for school. I dont even want to arrest her if possible, I just want to live in my own home in peace\n\nAdditional info: my mom owns the house and its completely paid off, so I assume if somebody had to file some sort of restraining order she would have to do it. The only people currently living here is me, my mom, my mom’s brother, and my sister. My bf was staying here temporarily. We are located in Florida \n\nTLDR; my sister (30’s) keeps harassing and occasionally physically harming me (17) and my mom(50’s). I called the police on her recently and I am worried she will lay hands on me for it so I want to know a way to safely remove her without hurting anyone \n\nIf there is any crucial information I am missing please let me know and I will edit the post. I sometimes have trouble recalling events that stress me out so theres a good chance something may be missing (which I apologize for) Thank you for any advice I may receive ",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nIn September I signed a new lease with my girlfriend at a newly constructed apartment promising one month of free rent. However, after the lease was signed, we noticed that they put two free months of rent (October and November 2024) versus one.\n\nWhen November came and we had charges due, we emailed our property manager saying that our lease said we had two months free instead of one, asking for the charges to be dropped. They initially did drop them, but then came back to us with emails pointing out that before the lease was signed we 'agreed' to a one-month free concession, despite admitting their future mistake on the lease. Now, we have a new addendum presented to us without November included that we have not signed and they're expecting us to pay.\n\nI've read here that multiple people say a judge could look at the totality of the situation and side with the landlord if there's enough evidence that it was a mistake. Also, even if they grant us our wish, they could make life difficult elsewhere like on move out, with maintenance, etc. However, would like more opinions on if we should fight back as it's a legally binding document!",

    "title": "Can I appeal claim reversal due to my employer's late notification of COBRA coverage termination in Tennessee?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI resigned from my job in Tennessee in late May due to health reasons. During my exit interview, my former employer informed me that my health coverage would end at the end of the month, so I planned to transition to my husband's insurance.\n\nHowever, when I checked my insurance app at the beginning of June for proof of coverage termination (as required by my husband's HR), I discovered my insurance was still active. I contacted customer service multiple times over the following months and was assured everything was fine.\n\nIn late August, I experienced a blackout event and had to go to the ER, where I received treatment, including a heart monitor. All my claims were processed by late September without any issues.\n\nRecently, I received a COBRA election notice from United Health stating my coverage was officially terminated on October 31, 2024. When I checked my insurance portal, I found out that they retrospectively ended my coverage on August 31, and all my September claims were reversed, totaling an additional $1,000 in medical bills.\n\nIt appears my former employer didn’t notify United Health about my coverage termination until October 22nd, which is 22 days late. According to COBRA rules, employers are required to inform the plan administrator within 30 days of a qualifying event, which in my case should have been by September 30th.\n\n[https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/cobra\\_fact\\_sheet](https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/cobra_fact_sheet)\n\nI'm worried because I found information on Tennessee's official sites suggesting that employees might have less protection in such cases. Specifically, there’s a note that if an employee fails to report a dependent’s loss of eligibility within 60 days, they won't be offered COBRA coverage, which makes me concerned about my own appeal chances for the denied claims. \n\n[https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/finance/fa-benefits/documents/cobra.pdf](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/finance/fa-benefits/documents/cobra.pdf)\n\nHas anyone dealt with similar issues in Tennessee? What are my options for appealing the claim denial, or should I consult a lawyer about this situation?  I'm a migrant worker and not very familiar with US laws. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks for your help!",

Driver stole them or delivered to a wrong address and they stole them. They would have had to sign for them. Contacted Apple, they looked into it and came back with \"We have completed our review with the carrier regarding your shipment and have determined that we are unable to provide a replacement or process a refund.\".Any help would be appreciated.\n\nAfter 4 Apple employees pretty much told me to get f'd I got a good one. Really helpful and talked to the manager for me. He said I was given bad info by other agents and if i get the police to contact apple they will re-open the investigation.\n\nProblem is Apple wants them to contact them and the police are telling me they dont contact people, the company needs to contact them.\n\nI am waiting for a cop to call me.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. It looks like this may not end well for me, do i have any recourse? \n\nThanks.\n\nNote: I am in Canada but their legal sub removed my post so i am asking here.",

During an unpaid meal break not only are you required to not work, but you are not required to stay at your place of business. You can wear whatever you like, go wherever you like, and leave the building. As you are not actively being paid your employer has no jurisdiction about what you do or where you go. If at any point your employer requires you stay, requires you to work, or even stay in uniform (if you have a dress code/ policy) then they have violated your meal break and you are entitled to compensation. I would still recommend looking up the specifics of your exact state but it’s very likely similar.\n\nFrom my experience the compensation given was money paid for working during breaks, as well as overtime as the breaks put the employees into an overtime area of total hours worked. \n\nWith all of that said. It sounds like your director or boss isn’t doing the right thing here, and they very well may push back if you correct them. I would 100% recommend documenting in writing every time you are not afforded a meal break, or other break and able to completely take that break. If you’ve already mentioned to them that you don’t think what they are doing is right; then I’d strongly recommend making sure that is in writing too. \n\nDepending on how good your relationship status is with your boss/ director it may behoove you to inquire about other prospective job opportunities, not saying they will terminate you for correcting them on your legally entitled breaks and the requirements thereof to constitute a break, but it’s not uncommon. \n\nHope your situation gets better, and that you get your breaks back at work.",

Mind you I didn't threaten her at all and told her to leave me alone several times leading to me blocking her completely. They said I had to go to the hospital no matter what I said. I have just been discharged and billed, very heavily. \n\nAm I able to sue her for this? The bill is ludicrous and having to pay for a fluke suicide call is crazy. Yes I'm in the US. ",

    "title": "building flooded, seeking advice on rent abatement/withholding",
    "selftext": "Btw, I live in Alameda County in California.\n\nOn Sunday, October 13th, my building flooded suddenly and rapidly due to an underground fire sprinkler pipe burst. About 15 tenants were affected and had their bottom floors flood with 4-6 inches of water. Property management has been timely in their remediation efforts, but have been extremely difficult to communicate with. They hired construction teams to immediately dry out our walls, repatch drywall, etc. but the job did seem very rushed. At this point (2.5 weeks later), most units are repaired, but the common areas and fire suppression system are still being worked on. \n\nDuring repairs, our bottom floors were unusable for over 2 weeks due to the remediation and construction. Some tenants were displaced during this time since they sleep downstairs, and most units had really poor air quality from the industrial fans blowing around the silt that came up with the flood. These units are also live/work spaces and many of us (including myself) have been unable to work due to space being unusable. \n\nWe believe we are entitled to rent abatement as stated in our leases:\"*Section 16.4 Abatement of Rent. If the Premises are partially destroyed or damaged and Landlord or Tenant repairs them pursuant to this Lease, the Rent payable hereunder for the period during which such damage and repair continues shall be abated in proportion to the extent to which Tenant’s use of the Premises is impaired. Except for abatement of Rent (if any), Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for any damage suffered by reason of any such damage, destruction, repair or restoration.*\" \n\nAfter days of little to no communication from property management (fire suppression had not been worked on for 9 days with no fire watch implemented, no communicated timeline about in-unit construction, not receiving responses to questions, etc), we sent a collective signed email as a notice of rent withholding until repairs are completed and to request partial or total rent abatement. We received a response within 24 hours that includes this excerpt: \"*I just spoke with the insurance adjuster, and unfortunately because bedrooms, bathrooms, & kitchens were still \"liveable\", there is no legal basis for rent abatement. As a person and a renter, I feel for each and every one of you, however this was an accident that was out of human control.*\"\n\nThe units in our building are all undefined live/work loft spaces that don't have walls to separate bedrooms, kitchens, etc. Many tenants have effectively lost their \"bedroom\" during this time as they sleep downstairs, where the flood occurred. Our leases are also live/work leases, NOT residential leases and there is no language in this section containing the words \"kitchen\" or \"bedroom\" as these are all undefined spaces.\n\nAs of today, most repairs are completed and the fire suppression system should be up and running by EOD today or tomorrow. We have until the 7th to pay rent without late fees. I had a few brief phone calls with legal aid organizations saying that we should still pay our rent and file a rent adjustment petition with the city or take property management to small claims court. However, some folks in my building disagree and think we should keep withholding rent as a method to get property management's attention to ALL of the complaints and repairs that have needed to be addressed for quite some time (ie broken mailboxes, building security, lack of fire watch during the time fire suppression was down). \n\nI know there is power in organizing and collective bargaining. However, since most flood related repairs are close to completion at this point, I'm not sure we have much grounds for rent withholding at this point. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you in advance!",

    "title": "Advice on Real Estate Agent Misrepresentation/Negligence/False listing information in Virginia?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, Thanks in advance for reading this and for answering. I understand to contact an attorney and I have, I'm just awaiting their response and I'm trying to determine if this is even worth it. I'm really not sure what to do in this case if I can do anything, but I was definitely lied too, misrepresented and more. please let me know your thoughts.\n\nI'll try and make this as concise as possible. I recently purchased a Home in Virginia in one of my dream neighborhoods. I believe that I have a legal case, and I am just awaiting for multiple lawyers to respond to me, just trying to ask your all opinion to make sure I'm not blowing something out of the water. For reference the home is a 1.5 story home the second story does not meet clearance and was marketed as a 3 bedroom home. The previous person occupying the home was a renter and used the room upstairs as a room.\n\nFirst happening: I found a deal with someone willing to let me assume their mortgage in one of our desired areas to live, the agent that was supposed to be mentoring me in investment deals, told me they would not give me any advice on that deal since they were not \"representing me\" another deal popped up on the MLS while i was trying to learn how to do this that they had convinced me was a way safer area and although it was a fixer upper home they told me it would not cost very much (less than 60k) to create a 2nd story conversion on the 1.5 story that existed and to get the home turn key ready to go.(I believed this because they are home flippers) and although the 2.25 percent rate on the other home was a great deal, this would be even better because I could add an ADU and rent it out on airbnb and it would cover the mortgage. Needless to say I'm pretty stupid for believing all of this and we went under contract. We had an inspection contingency, which I was pretty sure I wanted to use to get out of the home because i had a gut feeling and so when they had agreed to split the commission with me, they asked me, \"What percentage are you looking for\" they knew how important it was for me to get as full to the closest commission possible so I asked if they would be willing to do 1% and i could receive the 2%. They obviously didn't agree to that and i told them at that point I wanted out of the contract. The wife of my agent texted me and said an emotionally charged message saying I need to reframe and how she took on all the liabilities and legalities and work to be my agent, and that I'm not that heartless to make someone do their job for nothing, and at the end of her message said, that as a reminder if we send a release you're under contract so procuring cause is in place.\n\nAt this point I didn't know what to do, I felt like no matter which way i would go, I had asked if they could switch the contract to someone else and they told me that's not possible after the contract is ratified, their broker confirmed that's not true. I tried asking the broker if their was anything that could be done because I did not feel like my best interests were being put in place. Also, The agent had implied that there was a signed buyer broker agreement which was signed upon my part, but they did not sign and never disclosed that to me. The broker did absolutely nothing for me. My agent didn't look at my inspection report, she didn't provide any feedback or any disclosure. The appraisal came in, and came in 20k higher than our contract price, but the discrepancy and i did not find this out until after I closed on the home, was that the home only appraised as a 2 bedroom, and after having multiple contractors coming in they say its not even safe to use the upstairs as there is only 1/2 inch plywood that's holding the floor up. We had planned on using this bedroom upstairs as a bedroom for me and the kids, as it was the biggest bedroom in the home. This was not disclosed to us that it did not count. Towards the end of the contract i opened up and found out my son needed surgery and trying to figure out how to afford this higher monthly payment each month was going to be near impossible, there was no discussion of trying to help us out. I feel so wronged, and this house is in even crappier condition than we thought.\n\nTL:DR:\n\nAgent did not send me release when asking to be released, was coerced and scared into fulfilling the contract as they threatened to sue me if I backed out, there was an implied buyer broker agreement, but the buyers agent never actually signed it. Was given false information about the costs it would be to fix the home. Inspection wasn't looked at to determine what was wrong. Even just the foundation clean up is costing me 4 grand. The appraisal did come in 20k higher but did not appraise as a full 3 bedroom when we were planning on using the 3rd bedroom but have now been advised it is dangerous to be upstairs and this was never disclosed to me and now I'm looking at about 125,000 to get this upstairs to be converted into a bedroom. Is there any recourse i can take, is this worth while to pursue.",

    "title": "How can we stop a gold digger from taking advantage of our elderly grandpa? ",
    "selftext": "This is a long one but we need help and need to know if there’s any possible legal recourse. \n\nMy husband’s grandpa (M91) was heavily pursued by another elderly woman (F86) and ended up marrying her 10 years ago. She is a woman who has a reputation for having married several husbands who were widowed and elderly who died within a couple years of marriage and she was able to scheme to take a large portion of their estate if not everything. I don’t think she expected my husband’s grandpa to survive so long. Their marriage has been a sham but grandpa is too old to realize that she is only there because he is wealthy. They do not show affection, do not share a bedroom, she talks very poorly about him and has since the moment they got married, she does not care for him etc. by all accounts she’s a roommate who is essentially leeching on him but he’s head over heels for her and won’t see it. \n\nThe current issue— he is nearing the end of his life and can not leave the bed at all. Can’t go to the bathroom on his own, can’t hold a pen, can’t have a phone conversation. He’s very much not in good condition. She has already purchased another home for herself in another state and begun taking small steps toward moving into that home. She’s totally checked out but is hanging around for the money. She took him to the bank— again he can’t even sit up for more than a couple minutes— and had herself added to his bank account. He would have NEVER done that in a sound mind. She’s been asking for that for their entire marriage and he has adamantly said “no” but she took advantage of his current state to do that. She is now going behind the rest of the family’s backs to hire lawyers to change and modify his existing will. The lady will we happened to see favored her over the rest of his children and allowed her to walk away with the majority of his assets and life’s work. \n\nIs there anything at all we can do? We are in the home daily taking care of him. Previously she wouldn’t allow that and told us she had it handled and was VERY adamant about nobody coming into HER home without permission— all visits with him are heavily monitored by her. She won’t leave the room. But when she was away on one of her many trips to purchase her new home we checked on him and the state she left him in was deplorable— nearly deceased and covered in feces and starved with no access to his medications. So my husband’s family essentially said “screw that” and hasn’t left his side since despite her many protests. She refuses to allow a caregiver in the house and dismisses any that we attempt to hire as it’s her private property and she doesn’t want them there. It feels as though she’s trying to hasten his death with lack of care so that she can get a large payout. \n\n",

    "selftext": "California. This is a long story but I’ll try to keep it succinct.\n\nMy dad had Solar installed on his roof in 2013, during one of the longest drought in California history. The roof above the bedroom started leaking very first time it rained nearly a year later. They tried saying it was an existing leak and our roof was old, but they eventually came out and “repaired” it. We went another 9-12 months without rain.\n\nThe roof is a flat gravel roof and when they repaired it, they scraped the gravel away in a 10’ x 10’ area and put down a white roofing liquid. They cut out the wet drywall in the ceiling and pulled the insulation and that’s when we saw that they drilled too deep and you can actually see the screw that punctured the wood and funnels the water down. It has leaked every intermittent rain since they installed the panels.\n\nMy dad passed in 2020 and I inherited the house.\n\nNow the area where they removed the gravel is lower than the surrounding area and water pools and sits there. The standing water has weakened the layer they put down and the roof now leaks in other areas.\n\nI called them again and they sent out a $1,000 check to repair it on our own, which I didn’t agree to and never cashed the check. I got my own roof inspector who said they should have removed ALL the gravel when they first installed the solar panels and the whole roof is damaged from them and it’ll cost $14,000 to repair.\n\nI called AGAIN and they started another claim and took the panels off for repairs. Halfway through their process, they’re now denying the damage claim saying that the warranty they offer is expired.\n\nOn top of all this, they’re still charging me my estimated solar charge even though the panels were removed in July and they aren’t generating anything, so I’m double paying for electricity.\n\nI believe my contract includes forced binding arbitration so I’m not sure what’s involved in that process, what I need to prepare, and if I even have a chance.\n\nBtw, the reason why this has gone on for 11 years is a combination of lack of rain between repairs and them stringing me along after every call, saying they’ll call back in 5-10 business days and then ghosting me and I have to start the process all over again.",

EMS 'found' him on ground outside the vehicle on their arrival.  Cop was unable to interview him about the incident at the scene - non-responsive... This was a Saturday at about 3AM. Hospital released to me to take him home a few hrs later. laceration to back of head but no serious injury..car probably totaled- major front end damage and is impounded. So far there's been no contact from the officer who wrote the report...it was still incomplete according to the SHerriff's records' department as of yesterday (2 days later). Is there a chance there would be no charges filed and otherwise...would they attempt to deliver a citation or talk to him at some point or..is it possible they would simply 'let it go...'  -  It's strange that no one has been in contact about it at all.  Also, even if they get the hospital's report of the specific BAC level.. technically there is no proof he was driving the car since he was discovered 'outside' the vehicle.  He wasn't found \"in\" the car - and the Crash Report only presumes he was the driver.  There was no damage to any property AFAIK except his vehicle.  What should he do if anything?",

    "title": "Attorney says he will take action if I extort him or defame him. Is this valid? [USA - California]",
    "selftext": "I was supposed to get married two months ago but ended up having only a ceremonial wedding without a marriage license. Here’s the story.\n\nI’m retired and financially stable, while my partner of four years has far fewer resources. Knowing marriage was ahead, I proposed a prenup to protect us both, and she agreed.\n\nI hired a family law attorney with decent reviews and a $3,500 flat fee, which seemed fair at the time. Unfortunately, my interactions with him were minimal, handled mostly through his paralegal. The draft his firm produced was a boilerplate, heavily skewed in my favor—it excluded my fiancée from spousal support, estate plans, and any community property—without any consultation or input from me. I spoke with him maybe two or three times, briefly, and received little guidance.\n\nLacking prenup experience, I assumed this draft was just an initial version that would be adjusted through negotiations. But when my fiancée and her attorney received it, they were furious, calling it “unconscionable.” My fiancée felt betrayed, convinced I was intentionally shutting her out of any future financial security.\n\nThis strained our relationship severely, and I tried to repair things by suggesting fairer terms to my attorney. My attorney’s responses, however, were dismissive and unhelpful. With our wedding date approaching, we were stuck: cancel everything and risk social and financial fallout, or proceed without finalizing the prenup. We chose the latter, having a ceremonial wedding with plans to settle the prenup and marriage license afterward.\n\nThe wedding itself was wonderful, and we enjoyed a brief honeymoon respite. But as soon as we returned, the tension resurfaced. My wife spends most of her time alone, deeply hurt, and our trust is frayed. I hired a prenup mediator and sought couples therapy, but the unresolved prenup continues to cast a shadow.\n\nRealizing my original attorney wasn’t going to help, I consulted potential new lawyers who specialized in prenups. They confirmed that I’d received poor service and insufficient guidance from the first attorney. My wife even drafted her own terms, and I worked on a fair response using ChatGPT. When I recently shared these with my attorney (who I stuck with out of sunken cost fallacy), he gave vague, dismissive feedback, ignoring my follow-up email for nine days.\n\nFed up, I demanded a full refund for his inadequate service. He responded defensively, suggesting it was my responsibility to review the draft thoroughly, and even hinted at defamation when I mentioned leaving an honest review.\n\nIn hindsight, I should’ve hired a prenup specialist. But I also believe it was the attorney’s duty to guide me through this process responsibly. I plan to leave factual reviews, and as long as I stick to the truth, I don’t believe there’s a case for defamation. I’m also not trying to “extort” him; I simply want fair compensation for services not rendered.  When I politely and professionally communicated this to him he vaguely implied he would pursue me for defamation and extortion.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this would be appreciated.",

I called quite a few attorneys at the time and received fees anywhere from $1K to $700+ hourly.

Biggest reason you can call them a squatter right now is the fact they lived there WITH your permission so that means you knew they were there and were fine with it up until you wasn't. (Doesn't matter the reason, that's just how the course view it, just be sure you're wanting them out for a legal reason)\n\nYour best course of action and possibly only one is to go speak with a tenant law lawyer (the field they practice in might be under real estate law) and go from there but you'll need to start an eviction process if you want them gone and yes just wanting them to sign an agreement (that is legal) and them refusing is a justified reason for eviction. It's different in every state but that would be the basic process here, if you are having difficulties with then don't handle it yourself, you can get yourself into some major legal trouble.\n\nSince they are tenants the cops won't do anything unless you provide proof of them breaking the law as it is considered their home currently and the cops can't remove them without a judgement from the judge (otherwise people would be having the cops remove people from their homes left and right just by telling a good story to make them believe it)",

When I submitted my notice to vacate the leasing agent asked me if I had a deal when l moved in and I said yes, she went to go check since she said this would have to be paid back. I told her that it was on my first lease and I am breaking the renewal, so she said \"oh okay you wouldn't have to pay it back then, but I don't see it on your account anyways\". \n\nI checked my account and sure enough it was never applied. I originally signed to be in another unit, but they asked me to switch to a different unit after the current tenants of that unit wanted to withdraw their notice to vacate. When I switched units they confirmed they would honor the special, as confirmed in email from the manager. I don't have a copy of the documents for that original unit since I switched to my current unit, and the first lease (of the unit I am in) does not mention the deal for the $1500 off. I tried to negotiate down the penalty at the beginning by mentioning the situation and how they asked me to be flexible and now I am asking them to be the same. They didn't budge. But now I am asking them to honor the deal that I did not receive but should have and reduce the $1500 from my termination penalty. \n\nSince it was originally signed to a different unit but I do not have those documents as it was all docusign and the link is no longer valid (not sure if they have a copy).

But given that a civil court operates on a preponderance of evidence the question of why it was an issue until now could be relevant. The email is evidence that could prevail in the absence of evidence to the contrary..\n\nThese will almost certainly be considered separate legal questions for the court. In effect you owe the full $6000 regardless of whether you can recover the $1500 or not. You generally can't mix the too issues to offset obligations. You need to talk to a real lawyer in your area, and definitely have the full $6000 in escrow at the very least. You do not want to look like you are simply trying to dodge your contractual obligations. That looks bad under a preponderance of evidence. Best case is you pay the full $6000 and then sue for the $1500. While keeping all records pertaining to the $1500 and trying to get the deal honored through an offset. That way your willingness to honor your contractual obligations will not be questioned by the court.",

When asked if we could see a copy of the demand letter they’re supposedly using in their negotiations, they said that “they have an outline on their notepad.” We asked them to send over the pictures of the notes to see if they’ve actually written out the legal violations they’ve found with the case and zero response. \n\nAm I being rushed or too skeptical that there’s potentially no actual demand letter and that this was a stalling technique because the attorneys needed more time to prepare a complaint maybe?

A South Carolina state trooper responded to the scene, arrested the driver, and subsequently issued a seat belt ticket to my boyfriend, even though he was not in the truck due to the accident.\n\nThe issue we face now is that we have been unable to locate this ticket, and inquiries with South Carolina authorities indicate that there is no record of it. However, the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (NC DMV) claims there is an outstanding seat belt ticket in South Carolina that needs to be paid, along with a reinstatement fee, for my boyfriend to reinstate his driver's license.\n\nWe retained a lawyer in North Carolina who successfully dismissed unrelated charges (reckless driving and racing). However, he informed us that he could not address the seat belt ticket issue, as it pertains to South Carolina and did not appear on my boyfriend’s record.\n\nGiven these circumstances, we are seeking your guidance on the following:\n\n* How is it possible that South Carolina has no record of this ticket, yet North Carolina still requires payment for it?\n* What steps can we take to verify and resolve this issue to reinstate my boyfriend’s driver's license?\n* Would representation from a South Carolina-based attorney be necessary, or are there other legal pathways we can explore to resolve this interstate matter?\n\nYour advice on how to best proceed with this situation would be greatly appreciated, as well as any potential next steps for clearing his record.

    "title": "My manager gave me fake promises and later got me fired.",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing well. Sorry for the little long text you will have to read.\n\nAs the tittle says, My manager just screwed me over. I came to USA, California last year as a permanent resident. Immediately after arrival I got a job as an unarmed security guard and I was doing full-time graveyard shift. My job required to clock-in and out (this will be relevant to my story) and sometimes to give reports too. I was in charge of looking over a property and doing basic security stuff. So I did that for almost 7 months and the manager changed me to dayshift which was a huge upgrade for since we folks that did the graveyard shift know how exhausting it can be. Although the change made me have less hours(from 40 to 36), I was very happy with it and all the time I worked I never got any complaint against me, no warnings or any issues.\n\nOne day I receive a call from my Manager saying he has another site for me and would like to promote me as a supervisor because my good work. I got really excited and agreed because within one year of being in USA I was already getting promoted. Here is the part that I think I made a mistake. I never asked him to give me a writing proof but as he mentioned later on hiring page it doesn't say which position you are getting approved for. I was thinking it means more hours and I needed the money tbh. \n\nI left my dayshift job and went to work for him and do what he tells to do which was sometimes very hard. After 1 week I saw that my paycheck was the same and hours too. So I told him that I'm not happy and I would like to go back to my old job but he begged and said I'm going to fix your hours and I'll give you overtime  which was one of my conditions to keep continuing. I agreed and I was helping him with concert events, school events, meetings and even interviewing people instead of him.So this where my clock in and out issue comes. At times I was told by him to not clock in or out or sometimes he would add my hours later If was doing work on call because remember he told me to come and he'll give me overtime or essentially more hours.\n\n \nHere is the main issue, I did not know he pulled all the promotion nonsense out of his ass and nobody in the company besides him knew I was working in the office. This includes the HR and the owner of the company. The company was under the impression that I was still working on my dayshift. Until one day I was scheduled in the office from 9am to 5pm. I go there, clock in and start working. I get dont by 2pm and my boss says you can go home, I ask should clock out and he says no, he'll fix it. I go home and around 4 pm he calls me saying that the owner told him to fire both me and my colleague ( almost same story as me). I was shocked when I heard that the reason was I was unauthorized to work in the office and I was basically stealing hours with not clocking in or out all because my manager was telling me to. The worst part is my manager didn't get fired and I'm 100 percent sure he put all the blame on me and my colleague. Today I get the letter and I got terminated because the things I did not do. I'm so broken because my wife is sick and I'm currently in debt. The only reason I accepted the offer was just to get seen and have more hours/pay. They accused me of things that I did not do. I wanted to go to a lawyer to file a complaint against the company but I wanted to seek guidance first.\n\nDo I have a case?\nFeel free to ask any question you guys have.\n\n\n",

However, the roaches have just gone to everyone else's apartments now because they didn't treat the whole building. \n\nI have complained multiple times about the roaches. When I do complain, someone from building maintenance comes by with a bottle of pesticide and sprays a couple spots in my apartment (like under the fridge, the water heater closet, the front door). They also placed gel bait once when I escalated my complaint to their bosses back in August. \n\nHowever, these \"treatments\" are not working, because the roaches are everywhere in the building, not just my apartment. Unfortunately, only a couple other residents have bothered to complain and the others aren't doing anything about the problem. Building maintenance refuses to treat an apartment unless the tenant complains to them.\n\nI have bought my own pesticide, bait traps, and something to prevent the roaches from breeding, but more keep popping up because the issue isnt just my apartment. \n\nThis is Missouri. \n\nSo my question: do I have legal grounds to break the lease without paying out the fees stipulated in the lease?

    "title": "Is this a sound reason for breaking the lease? (TN)",
    "selftext": "I co-signed for my friend’s lease in Tennessee. They have decided to break the lease due to rat problems. The lease says that tenants are responsible for pests, but the pest control company we hired said that it would require much more than treating our apartment to fix the problem (the apartment is connected to a larger building). Rats would constantly bite through the plumbing and cause flooding. Additionally, my friend also had people run an inspection of the apartment and they told us it was out of code (but we did not submit a work order for that). My friend sent in notice to vacate in September and turned in the keys at the end of October.\n\nThe rental company is refusing fault and is requesting we pay the lease break fee (two months rent). Their website is also telling me I’m past due for November rent, but my friend already moved out and we no longer have the keys to the apartment. I live in California so I cannot speak with the rental company directly and they have no reliable phone number. My friend wants to fight the lease break fee legally (they have not yet contacted a tenant lawyer), but I am worried about it affecting my credit score. Is my friend’s argument for breaking the lease sound, or should I bite the bullet and pay to protect my credit score? Also, do I have to pay rent even though we are no longer living there?",

When I messaged him he says I’m on the hook for 3k+ of electrical repairs for more than just the outlets but to get the building up to code in general because lease stipulates I have to do repairs for things that were worn down due to “day to day wear and tear.” \nHe also expects me to replace the 22 year old furnace that had been documented the week I moved in of showing signs of failure alongside not remediating the serious mold issues in our ceilings.

    "selftext": "So my husband and I were talking to our friend about a car he had for sale.  The asking price is under $5,000.  We told him we were interested as a family member had totalled our car and we are a bit tight on funds at the moment.   We asked if he would be ok with us making payments over the next few months as we didn't have the asking price upfront.   He and his wife agreed.  About a month ago we had the money together to make our down payment and pay tax, title and plates (registration).  Then came the the car is not in running order.  Ok, what needs to be done.  Laundry list of stuff (basically making the car worthless).  Ok well we decided that we wouldn't transfer the title at that time but invest in getting the car road ready plus we gave half of the down payment to them as a good faith gesture with the statement made you will receive the other half when we transfer the title.  Two weeks go by and the car is running and road worthy.  We make the next payment and asked when we can do the title.  Our friend says his family member is a notary so she will do it for us (no problem we've used her before for other things) but for the last two weeks it's been one excuse after another, saying more things need to be fixed before they are willing to let us have it. We are now almost $2100 into this car with no ownership and they don't seem to want to sell the car.  Our one other friend was over at their place getting some breakwork and an oil change and saw the car sitting there.  They made mention about why we don't have it yet and they spewed another garbage can of excuses as to why (mostly revolving around only getting half the down payment).  They were told if they don't transfer soon and give us the vehicle we're probably going to demand our money back.  He told the he doesn't have  it and if we're going to be that way someone expressed interest in it the other day and he will just sell it to them (according to him they offered $4000 more than what he was asking for).  I think at this point we were being scammed by him and his wife knowing we were desperate for a vehicle and used us to provide the money to overhaul and turn the car over so they could sell it to someone else.  My question is when I demand my money back is 30 days to produce it legal or do I need to give them more time before I take them to court and put a lien on their car/property until they pay us back? (Yes we have notated records of the money we sent them as I sent the money through electronic service to have a record and paper trail, each was marked with what it was for.  At that point the agreement was verbal as they are our best friends. Not anymore though)",
