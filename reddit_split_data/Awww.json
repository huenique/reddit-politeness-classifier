I understand that there are ecological reasons to keep your cats in, and obviously if you live somewhere where there are animals which would prey on pets keep them safe. But I think it’s naive to assume that every cat owner is going to keep their cats indoors and therefore they’re basically fair game for being outside. I can’t tell if it’s a super American thing or just a Reddit thing but it there’s always someone in these threads ready to pounce with the ‘irresponsible cat owners’ speech like that’s enough to justify just taking the cat",
