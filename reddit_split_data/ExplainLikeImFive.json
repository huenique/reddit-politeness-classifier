I think it has something to do with a mix of a history of homogeneity (the people are mostly of a single race), Confucian values (social norms dictating your place in the world and the role you therefore serve), and being in insular places (thus making exchange of cultures less likely, and reinforces a sense of kinship).",

Also, the general high standard of living means petty theft is less common. When I lived in Tokyo I was definitely told to avoid some specific places at night. (Ueno being specifically shady at the time because it was a place for various traffickings, fake phone cards etc - yes, it was a long time ago, no idea today)",

Kids who act outside the norm end up shunned, resulting in an adult population that considers it their duty in life to be a good citizen, and also lives in fear of being someone who sticks out for going against others, let alone committing crimes. \n\nThe downside is extreme stress and people who are terrified of screwing up. You'll see it in shopkeepers who look like they'll die if they have made the smallest mistake.\n\nAlso, if you are convicted of a crime, you'll lose your job, your family, basically everything, and you'll be jailed for as little as stealing 100 yen (\\~$1). All those guys you see at construction sites guiding traffic -- that's where convicts end up after they are released as there is no other work they can do.",

Mostly just when I was home and it was spending the night outside, but never for going into shops or to the cinema.

There's very very little desperate poverty in Japan. The highest correlation with violent crime is poverty.\n\nCrimes not commonly associated with poverty are still relatively common in Japan. Sexual assault? Massive problem. Domestic abuse? Massive problem. Fraud, wage theft, preying on consumers? Absolutely atrocious.\n\nLike anywhere, if you want to commit a crime start a business, grow it large enough and even killing people (like working people to death in a black company) just gets you a fine. Stealing people's deposits? Fine. Charging them bullshit fines for canceling something outside some tiny window? Legal.\n\nThere's plenty of crime in Japan, just not random violent crime for the most part.",

Latter doesn't include guilty pleas and cases dismissed.\n\nIn comparison, Japan's conviction rate is a whopping 99%. I believe Korea's conviction rate is similarly high. \n\nIn the States, if someone steals a wallet or phone, and it's a first-time offense, a good lawyer might get the offender a plea bargain for misdemeanor rather than a felony, with probation and a suspended sentence. If you don't commit another offense, then you have a good chance of rehabilitation and reintegration into society. \n\nIn Japan and Korea, if you're caught and the case goes to court, the likelihood of a conviction and prison sentence is significantly higher. And if word of your conviction gets out (it often does, unless your family is wealthy and powerful) there's a strong chance that your social standing will be ruined for a long time.\n\nMore broadly culturally, I got the sense that Japanese and Korean society have a higher respect for another person's personal property, even before considering the deterrents.",

You do not have the right to the prosecutions evidence (discovery).  You do not have the right to face your accuser.  You do not have the right to a fair or speedy trial.  You can be held indefinitely while the state 'builds their case'.  They do not require any significant evidence to hold you.  Your freedom is irrelevant.  Korea is similar in many of these respects.\n\nBoth of these countries also have extremely strict and specific laws.  If you're an American, you would consider either of these countries fascistic, without question!  Gambling is illegal for citizens.  Whether you are inside or outside the country.  Smoke pot while on vacation where it's legal?  Jail.  10 years ago?  Jail.  Doesn't matter.\n\nI'll also close out with that these countries do have crime problems.  Japan has a sexual harrasment/assault problem.  So much so they have had to create train cars that are women exclusive and they've had to change laws to require all cameras to make noise on taking a picture that can't be silenced, ever.  Both of these countries with homophobia and beating up/lynching gay people.  These don't make the news because obviously this would look really bad but they are extremely traditional and tradition is not to be deviated from.  When it is, the reinforcement of it is basically looked the other way.",

        "comment_body": "I think there are a few factors :\n\n\n1. À general lack of extreme poverty and especially homelessness. Japan and South Korea both have very low homelessness statistics. Homeless are generally more likely to litter and engage in petty crime.\n2. Less classes that feel disenfranchised, in the UK and Ireland there's a significant contingent of the (usually white) working class and their children that feel excluded from and hostile towards the wider society. They have existed on the margins for generations, and have an entrenched sense of grievance, reinforced by many negative interactions with the education system and criminal justice system. Japan and South Korea have much less of this, though it's not non-existent. This dynamic replicated itself in British colonies often with racial minorities. In continental Europe this is present to a greater or lesser extent depending on the country. \n3. Culture. Some cultures just care more about (public) cleanliness. There are many countries which are otherwise similar where you can see this, eg compare Naples and Florence, or Marseilles and Lyon, or Berlin and Munich. \n\n\nFinally, often a small cause can end up magnifying itself, as when a small amount of litter is present, a larger number of people will start caring less and littering more. Conversely places do change. Taiwan used to be called trash island, now it's as clean as Japan. NYC's subway cars used to be covered in graffiti and filled with filth, now they're mostly clean. Cleanliness and dirtyness tend to propogate themselves. Clean places tend to stay clean because people don't want to be the first person to litter. Dirty places stay dirty because nobody cares and they just add their small piece of trash to the pile that's already there. ",

Lots of asian countries generally have a more society-focused philosophy over an individualistic one in western countries. This means people are prioritising social harmony and group needs over the needs of themself, leading to lower crime as it “disrupts” this social fabric.\n\n2. Higher minimum standards of living. We know full well that crime correlates very strongly with economic and education levels. People who live in first world countries are much less likely to experience crime simply because they are more well off. They don’t need to steal. If anything, the risk of going to jail far outweighs any benefit of stealing, and in the worst case, there are social safety nets like homeless shelters and food banks that provide the bare minimum standards of living so that people do not need to resort to crime.\n\n3. strong law enforcement. People are much less incentivised to steal if they are much more likely to be caught. But this requires more surveillance and police resources, which richer countries can afford. It also helps that most people live in very concentrated metropolitan areas (Seoul and Tokyo are extremely dense population centres), so the cost of administering additional police and surveillance is less than other countries where people are more spread out, and so would the resources.",

(So the boy was apologizing to Mr. Bookshelf)\n\nJapanese people are much more likely to be parented (corrected) by other parents/adults in a consistent manner where an American parent would be less comfortable correcting someone else’s child. And from a young age, it’s not about whether you hurt someone else, but whether your actions were appropriate and acceptable, so you get strong reinforcement to not only do the right thing, but to apologize when you’ve done something wrong.  \n\nWe moved stateside not long after that and my son use a broken door at my uncle‘s house where the door knob would easily come off. He walked up to my uncle holding the door knob and said, “I’m sorry uncle <name>, but I broke the door knob when I tried to open the door.“ My uncle was shocked at his reaction and praised me for how well I’d raised my son, but I don’t think it was an unusual reaction for a child raised in Japan.   \n\nAnyway, just some anecdotal stories. That bookshelf apology has stuck with me.  The combination of showing respect for an inanimate object and apologizing to it exemplify how Japanese culture emphasizes doing the right thing, showing respect and apologizing when you’ve done something wrong. ",

That is not to say inequality doesn't exist (because it absolutely does), but the countries that are the most unequal are the ones which have groups whose existence makes them a target of the dominant race/ethnicity/class, which therefore discourages robust and universal social policies designed to help disadvantaged people because most countries nowadays do not make policies that explicitly discriminate between race, for example, which means that those in power would rather deny help to everyone if it means a marginalized group won't receive it.\n\nThe US is the most notorious example. It has a long history of systematic oppression, therefore creating disenfranchised groups, leading to higher criminality. This combined with the fact that a substantial reason why social policies face opposition is that it would benefit poor people, non-white people, and immigrants in general, and that is not of interest to those in power.\n\nI would be incredibly skeptical of people claiming it has anything to do with immigration; studies in the US show immigrants commit less crime than citizens.

But when we met with the Japanese team, their initial response was along the lines of “no one would do that here, that’s wrong!” It was only after we provided specific examples of fraudulent claims that the US and UK teams were looking for that they relented and agreed that happened with their members as well.

All this generates a higher trust society.\n\nThe collective society vs the individualist society is very large difference but also the racial and ethnic diversity plus growth in liberalism means the West has too many differences so society is unstructured and as such chaotic. Throw in natural differences eg Testosterone and Religious for example (see voting lines or obsession with equality in the West) which means different incompatible value systems and norms and this also feeding into institutions in the West making them ineffective, means more low trust society formation. Eg “Why work hard when my taxes are taken off me and given to drug users or criminals or illegal immigrants?” Erosion of shared values, different values all leads to a creaking system. It is equivalent to the “broken windows” theory where the perception on no one gives a shit informs people as well as reinforces people eg litter on streets or side of road in country is “someone else’s problem”.

When I was staying in roppongi, I would hang out and people watch, and I saw at least 4 tourists/ex-pats get their shit swiped by teens or mid-30s men. Whenever folks post their experience online though, they're immediately gaslit by folks that they probably just forgot it somewhere.",

Yakuza are run like business, just more violent, they have office, venues, investments, and run chartity events.\n\nAs for the blind eye part, here's the thing, Japanese government DID perform many Yakuza crackdowns, limiting the scope of their operations and businesses. but the Yakuza exist far longer than the current Japanese government, we talking all the way back to 17th century. with that deep root, its better to have agreements in the open, than let it run rampant in the dark.\n\nWe can actually see the effectiveness of this approach, gang wars to the extent of Mexico or US is nearly unheard of in Japan. and regardless of how you feel about this approach, its undeniable that organized crime will exists regardless of how hard you try to crack down on it.",

I could only imagine how much more countercultural they'd get without the eye of the communist censor on their backs.\n\nI think THE factor here is urbanisation, the movement from rural villages where everyone knows everybody else to large cities where everyone relates to everyone largely through faceless bureaucracies.

        "comment_body": "According to that page, a more recent study found no relationship:\n\n> Bell et al. (2013) examine local crime patterns in England and Wales from 2002 to 2009  in order to determine whether there is any causal effect of an increase in the foreign-born population on crime. They focus on two large groups of migrants that arrived in the UK over this period. First, asylum seekers arising initially from the dislocations in former Yugoslavia and subsequently from war-torn societies such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, the large migrant flows coming from the A8 countries, particularly Poland, since 2004. The research showed that it is possible to derive causal estimates for both migrant groups and found that the share of asylum seekers in the local population was related to a rise in property crime, while a rise in A8 migrants was associated with a fall in property crime. Neither group was associated with statistically significant changes in violent crime. Estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in the asylum seeker share of the local population is associated with a 1.1% rise in property crime. Since asylum seekers accounted for only around 0.1% of the population, the macro effects were small. A one percentage point increase in the share of the population that was born in the A8 countries leads to 0.4% fall in property crime.\n\n> Bell et al. (2013) suggest that the estimated effects for asylum seekers and A8 migrants may be the result of differences in the labour market opportunities of the two groups. The A8 migrants who arrived in the UK came almost entirely for work reasons and have higher employment rates than the UK-born. The motivation of asylum seekers was different, and they are not allowed to work in the UK upon arrival and also have reduced access to welfare benefits. Given the lengthy process involved in deciding asylum applications, this restriction is likely to have increased the relative returns to crime.\n\nI also searched for additional studies and found this study looking at recent Eastern European (A8) immigration, also showing no relationship between immigration and violent crime: https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128714542500\n\nThis UK study also finds no relationship in either A8 or non-A8 groups, even when looking at London which experienced the heaviest influx: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/2193-9039-2-19.pdf\n\nAgain, this is all through a cursory search, but it does seem like several papers show little to no relationship with crime on average, and where such a difference exists, it is mostly explained by socioeconomic factors which can be addressed. \n\nThere is also the very observable fact that developed countries' crime rates have continued to decrease even as immigration has increased heavily. This would contradict the notion of immigrant criminality.",

Most of my single women friends (locals too) will go to bars solo, walk at night solo, and have no issues with taking Grab bikes or taxis solo.\n\nLeaving a laptop or phone plugged in or on a counter at a cafe while you head to the toilet is reasonably common. Someone just did it a moment ago here, at the cafe I'm in at this moment. The scenario of leaving your phone or wallet at a bar and picking it back up is like a slam dunk answer of \"yeah it'll be there\" in almost all situations.

I don't know where your house is, which gangster bars you've been going to, or which shady-ass restaurants you frequent, but here it is safe.\n\nThe topic of police force *responsiveness*, by the way, is not equivalent to (or a reasonable proxy for) safety.

It's more accurate to say that your body can get along just fine without it even though nothing 'takes over' for the gallbladder. It'd be strictly more efficient if it was still there.\n\nBile is a byproduct of broken down old red blood cells. Our bodies are normally really good at reusing byproducts, but bile is one of those end products that it can't keep recycling into new red blood cells. Instead it repurposes it for digesting fatty food.\n\nFat is oil soluble but not water soluble. Your digestive track needs it to be water soluble to absorb it. Bile just happens to be a good emulsifier, which makes oily things dissolve in water.\n\nYou're liver is constantly producing bile. Normally the gallbladder stores it so it can deliver extra bile when you eat something fatty. Without it there, your liver just constantly leaks out bile instead of storing it.\n\nThose without gallbladders digest food a bit less efficiently than those with gallbladders. Without the ability to store extra bile, there's no way to add extra bile to digest extra fatty foods. They just have to make due with what the slow drip the liver constantly produces.\n\nSome people see being less efficient at digesting fats as a good thing. Some experience oily stool as a result. From what I've heard, it takes a bit of adjusting but eventually the body just gets used to this new normal.",

A uranium \"bullet\" is shot down into a barrel into a stationary uranium target by the explosion of a conventional propellant. This is the simplest design for a nuclear weapon, the Manhattan project scientists were so confident it would work that they did not test the weapon before it was dropped on Hiroshima. But, gun type weapons are not efficient. Of the 64kg of uranium fuel in Little Boy, less than a kilogram actually underwent fission. The explosion blows the core apart before the fission reaction can run to completion.\n\nFat man used an implosion design. Instead of having two separate pieces of fuel material, Fat Man contained a spherical core of plutonium which was *not* enough for a critical mass. This was surrounded by high explosives, which were carefully shaped to create a spherical shock wave that would compress the core. This is a far more complicated but more efficient system.\n\nAlso note that the critical mass of a bare sphere of uranium is about 50kg while for plutonium, it is only 10 kilograms. But, plutonium also has a higher spontaneous fission rate. That means plutonium cannot be used in a gun type weapon like Little Boy, because the assembly is too slow - spontaneous fission will start the reaction before the core has been fully assembled, and the weapon will explode with greatly reduced yield (a fizzle). There were plans for a plutonium gun type weapon - the \"thin man\" design - but these were abandoned when they realized it wouldn't work.",

The faster you can get the two parts together, the more mass reacts before the boom.\n\nThe gun type is limited by the velocity of the gun (IIRC, a modified anti-aircraft cannon barrel).

        "comment_body": "Nuclear bombs require supercritical fissile material, that is fissile material in a high enough density or amount that each fission event statistically triggers more than one following fission, thus leading to an exponential growth of the fission reactions (if one fission event triggers less than one other event the mass is subcritical, if it triggers on average exactly 1 then the mass is critical. Anything above 1 is supercritical)\n\nFor obvious reasons, your bomb can't be supercritical whilst you transport it, thus a method to take subcritical fissile material and turn it supercritical on demand is required.\n\nThere's two basic ways to achieve this. An implosion type bomb wraps a slightly subcritical mass of material in a bunch of explosives When the explosives detonate, the pressure wave compresses the fissile material so much it achieves supercriticality.\n\nA gun type design takes a supercritical mass of fissile material and seperates it into two pieces: One cylindrical and one ring shaped, with the cylinder being the exact same size as the hole in the ring. You now load those two masses at the ends of a barrel and pack a whole bunch of explosives behind the cylindrical slug. When the explosives detonate the slug is fired into the ring, effectively combining the two masses resulting in one supercritical mass.\n\nThe reason an implosion type design is more efficient is because a higher level of supercriticality can be achieved. A fundamental problem with nuclear bombs is that as soon as runaway fission starts, the energy released causes all of the remaining fissile material to be scattered, halting the fission reaction almost as soon as it started. Thus, the more supercritical you can make the fissile material at detonation, the quicker the fission reactions will occur, and the more of your material will actually have a chance to undergo fission before being scattered.\n\nThe implosion type design is able to achieve a higher level of criticality, since a gun type is hard limited to just shy of 2 critical masses, since both the slug and ring must individually be subcritical, whereas an implosion type is only limited by the strength of the surrounding explosives. Since the explosives entirely surround the fissile material, it also takes until the fission pressure exeeds that of the explosives until material is ejected, wheras the gun type design es externally exposed to normal pressure on most of its surface area, meaning material can be ejected sooner.",

The specific example of the weather being a non-linear or chaotic system was discovered in the 1960s by a dude named Edward Lorenz. He had a computer he was using to predict the weather. This was back in the days when computers still had paper inputs and outputs. He found that his printer and computer rounded to minutely different numbers ie 0.0000001 difference. This difference created vastly different results from what he had expected. He then coined the term \"the flap of a gulls wings\" (which turned into a butterflies) referring to a very small change in initial conditions. \n\n  \nThe Atmosphere is a different story. GENERALLY the atmosphere takes a very long time to change. In the terms of hundreds if not thousands of years. This means that you can easily track its progress over a few years. You will start to see some trends. From the trends you see you can extend those out, if this continues to change at this rate, what will happen?

        "comment_body": "I think you're mistakenly seeing \"climate\" as a summation of the independent variable \"weather\", and when you take weather trends over long periods of time, you get the climate. \n\nHowever it's more that climate drives weather, not the other way around. \n\nClimate is determined by things on a larger, geological scale. Things that don't change day to day or year to year.\n\nThe biggest factor is the sun, earth's orbit around it, and earth's rotation about its axis. As a result, areas near the equator get a lot of sun exposure year round, and they get the most concentrated solar rays (near 90° angled rays). Meanwhile at the poles, the light comes in at a much sharper angle resulting in lower concentration. The farther from the equator, the shorter the days are as well, so there's simply less time in a day that the sun spends heating the surface.\n\nBecause our axis is tilted, when the north pole is angled away from the sun, it's winter in the northern hemisphere. When the north pole is angled towards the sun, it's summer. The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe rotation of the earth also induces large wind patterns which contribute to *the prevailing winds*. Where I live, the prevailing winds blow from West to East. It's more common for local weather to move West to East.\n\nAnother climate factor is geographical formations like mountain ranges. Air that sweeps in from an ocean may hit mountain ranges and have predictable effects. e.g. The prevailing winds from the Pacific Ocean sweep west and eventually hit the Rocky Mountains. A lot of this weather is warm and moist. As it's pushed up the Rockies higher into the atmosphere, the pressure changes with altitude and causes moisture to drop out as rain and snow. This same air then sweeps down the Rockies, now dry of moisture, and as it compressed under more atmospheric pressure warms back up, bringing a warm, dry wind down the mountains. This creates a high moisture climate on the windward side of the mountains, and a dry climate on the leeward side. They call this the Chinook winds in North America.\n\nJust as we have prevailing winds, we have prevailing ocean currents as well. An ocean current from a tropical region can deliver a constant supply of warmer water, which contributes to warmer winds and coasts. The Gulf Stream originates from the Gulf of Mexico, sweeps up the US southeastern coast, and crosses the Atlantic towards Western Europe. It's the reason that the UK has a relatively temperate, wet winter compared to Northern Ontario and Quebec, despite them being at the same latitude.\n\nOcean currents are also part of what generates hurricanes in the South Atlantic. Hurricanes are variable in size, intensity, and direction, but hurricanes are part of the climate in the south eastern United States. It's normal for them to happen.\n\nThe factors that drive climate don't change. They stay the same.\nThat's why things like global warming/climate change is so important. We're not just affecting weather, we're affecting *climate*. Some places are going to be warmer, some are going to be colder. Weather patterns driven by climate factors are going to change. Some for the better, some for the worse.",

If you want a \"climatologist\" (meteorologist?) you should try on r/askscience.\n\nThe truth is, that climate models or weather models, however you call it do suffer from the difficulty in tracking a lot of variables. Whether this is an issue depends on what you are wanting to do. We have gotten very good at predicting, e.g. the path and strength of hurricanes/monsoons and can predict rain a few days ahead to high accuracy. These predictions, however, are computationally expensive so your local weatherman isn't running a model to the same fidelity. The resources of local meteorologists also vary, e.g. if you live near a doppler radar you will have more accurate predictions because that is better equipment than most weather stations have. \n\nIf you care about larger weather/climate patterns, like ocean currents, then you can opt to ignore a lot of variables to make the model easier to run on a computer. And typically, these larger-scale patterns do not need to be resolved quickly (like modelling for rain tomorrow is done daily) so they can take long to make more accurate predictions. By ignoring these variables, you lose some fidelity, but the computational cost savings make it worthwhile to do so.",

However, we will continue to be surprised too. For example, decreased ocean shipping during the pandemic and agreements to reduce particulate pollution from ships contributed to the unprecedented ocean temps and warmest summer on record because it works out our pollution was creating clouds that reflected more sunlight.

That said, weather predictions today are actually pretty accurate out to a few days because we use previous weather patterns to help predict future weather patterns.  For example, if you have a low pressure system with a relatively high level of humidity moving in from the north west and you know that the last time this happened the weather was rainy you can predict with some degree of certainty that this weather pattern will result again in rainy weather.  The problem with longer range predictions is that you don't have enough factors to be able to predict if the weather patterns are going to be the same as previous - in the previous example, if that low was a more than a few days out from coming over you might have a high pressure system swoop in from the south which pushes that low pressure system north a bit which changes that potential rainy weather to clear blue skies.\n\nBasically it all works out to the fact that the closer you get towards predicting weather patterns rather than climate patterns the more chaotic the system gets as there are just so many little factors that come into play to generate the weather patterns.",

It has some residual heat from its formation (a liquid mantle) and radioactive decay- both known and relatively stable values that are measurable. Those are outweighed by the enormous amount of energy the Earth continuously receives from the Sun: also relatively constant and measurable. \n\nSince we’re in a vacuum, the only way the Earth can rid itself of heat is through (mostly infrared) radiation. That rate varies with the surface temperature and the insulating properties of the atmosphere. We lose heat mostly into the night sky, off into space. \n\nThe property that a hotter surface radiates more energy is easy to demonstrate in a lab. The effect accelerates with temperature - twice as hot is _more_ than twice the heat loss, so in any system we eventually reach equilibrium.\n\nFor us humans, that equilibrium is just about perfect. We have liquid water, a range of different surface temperatures, and we can move around to seek out ideal conditions. More important: the conditions support the rest of our food web and plants give us plenty of oxygen.\n\nWe can’t meaningfully change how much solar energy the Earth receives. And we know that the atmosphere _has_ been radically different in its long history - from unsurvivably hot to a solid ball of ice (“snowball Earth”).\n\nWe know that methane and carbon dioxide both act as insulators. But they’re naturally occurring and have settled into an equilibrium too. For a thousand years humans understandably believed that these forces of nature were more powerful than anything we could possibly do. The Earth was too big, too old, for us puny humans to make a difference. We’re mere passengers.\n\nBut we overran the planet- invaded every corner of it, and started to make massive changes to its surface. We dug up and burned vast quantities of carbon. So in the 1940’s, a bunch of fossil-fuel-industries set out to prove what we already thought was true: there was no way humans could affect the climate. We were too small, the balancing forces of nature too great.\nE\n\nThey proved the opposite. That CO2 released into the atmosphere was already upsetting the very equilibrium that life on Earth depended on.  And that the effect is slow: increasing CO today raises the surface temperature _in the future_.\n\nCO2 levels in the atmosphere today are higher than they’ve ever been in human history.

By looking at the sales performance of all the stores across the whole country, for the last 50 to 100 years. That huge amount of data smooths out random variations based on locations or a really unusual week or month or even year. And gives a very good picture of underlying trends. That allows you to better predict what's likely to happen going forward.

Now of course some of that are bigger/newer houses being build, but this is only a small percentage.

They don't want to buy the house at 50 when the kids are moving out. \n\nThere is also the opportunity cost of paying rent for which one gets nothing vs. at least some of a mortgage paying down the loan; the mortgage gets relatively cheaper over time as inflation makes paychecks, rent, and all goods/services higher over time (that $2000/mo mortgage is still $2000 20 years from now, but that $2000 rent is now $5000); and building equity as the home appreciates in value.

        "comment_body": "Not a financial expert but here’s the layman’s explanation as I understand it:\n1. Interest is the “price” you pay to borrow money. Nobody is going to loan you money for free.\n2. That $400,000 is a lot of money, but it’s discounted since much of it is future money which is worth less due to inflation. In 30 years, inflation could increase the price of eggs to $50 and minimum wage is $1million a year, but the numbers on your mortgage won’t change.\n3. That 7% is yearly so you pay 7% of the remaining value of the loan (the principal) in interest every year. For a long term loan like a 30yr mortgage this really adds up. This isn’t the correct calculation, but 7%*30=210% in interest. (The actual amount is a bit lower since you decrease the principal over time, which also decreases the dollar amount of interest every year).\n4. The lender could choose to not loan you the money and instead invest it in something like a govt bond that pays 5% for example. By lending to you at 7% they are trying to do 2% better than the “risk-free” rate and make more money overall. This is why mortgage rates are closely tied to the federal reserve (i.e. govt) interest rates. When the fed interest rates were really low a few years ago because of COVID this also made mortgage rates unusually low. Now that they raised the rates to fight inflation mortgage rates have come back up.\n5. Lending money to regular people comes with some risk that they will default and not be able to pay the loan back. This costs the lender money , so to offset it they may try to charge higher interest rates.\n6. Mortgages are a market and interest rates are determined by what people are willing to pay, i.e. supply and demand.\n6. Mortgage repayment is structured so each month you pay the same amount, regardless of how far you’re into the repayment. This is called amortization. Your example $200,000 7% 30yr has a monthly payment of $1330. In the first month, you would owe $1166 of interest (200000*.07/12). The remaining $164 goes towards lowering the principal. The loan is only paid off when the principal hits $0, so when you start a loan most of your payment goes to interest and the principal is only chipped away at very slowly.\n7. You can reduce how much interest you pay by 1) choosing a shorter term mortgage, but this increases your monthly bill which not everyone can afford, 2) getting a smaller mortgage/putting more down payment, again not everyone can afford this, or 3) getting a lower interest rate, but this depends on your credit score and market conditions, among other things.",

Roughly speaking, you could probably buy a $400,000 house with a 20% down payment, or $80,000 cash. \n\nBut now imagine you want to save the money upfront. So you rent a much smaller and less nice place for $2000 per month and invest the extra $1000 a month toward your future home.\n\nWith the $80,000 you started with plus the $1000 a month, even if you consistently earn 7% interest per year. It will take you 12 years to save up $400,000 in cash.\n\nBut in 12 years, that $400,000 house is probably going to cost significantly more.\n\nSo instead of living in that house for those 12 years and having a decent amount of equity built up as well as a mortgage payment you can handle, you will have lived for 12 years in a much less nice place, and still have to take out a large mortgage to buy the same house. Instead of being 18 years away from having a paid off house, you will now be 30 years away from having a paid off house.\n\nI'm not saying that homeownership is for everyone. There are a lot of expenses that go with it and a lot of hassles. Personally, I kind of hate owning a home.  but for most people who plan to stay in one place for a long time, homeownership is well worth it even with the cost of mortgage interest.",

A lack of supply, a huge demand and a lack of clear path to increasing supply means that this increase in value is unlikely to change anytime soon outside of sudden catastrophic events (e.g. major die out due to a pandemic or a war).  Given the average household post-tax income is just $100k per year there is no way for the average household to actually save up enough money to buy a house outright as their value is increasing faster than what that household could actually save per year.  Getting mortgage means that you can lock in your purchase price and even though you are often paying up to double the purchase price due to compounding interest you are still paying less than what your house is likely going to be worth at the end of the mortgage period.",

Inflation is needed because without it, it wouldn't encourage people to spend now, so on average inflation is about 3% per year. It cost $100 today and in 5yrs it will be around $115\n\nSo with inflation, there's interest. If you lent someone $100 of money and in 5 years they give you back $100, you technically just lost money. In the 5 years, you could've put that $100 in a high-yield savings account (HYSA, assuming 3% per year) and you could've had $115, meaning a $15 \"profit\" -- but in reality it's not really profit because of inflation.\n\nSo when a bank loans out a mortgage, there's interest. That interest (currently around 6%) is for 30 years, and it's compounded too. For the sake of simplicity, let's do simple interest, that's 6% times 30yrs which is 180%. So if you borrowed $100k for a house, you'll have to pay back the original $100k plus $180k of interest, totalling $280k. Now that $280k is divided over 30 years, which makes it out to be $778/month in monthly payment. (Of course this is just an oversimplified version of how mortgage work, the math is different cause it's compounded).\n\n.\n\nSo the reason people choose to buy a house with a mortgage is because they'll have a fixed cost for their living situation (whereas renting could increase) and if the house increase in value then you can always resell for profit.",

Obviously throwing your money away on rent is a waste and could add up to the cost of a mortgage, but it is what it is.\n\nHowever if you do end up in a mortgage it is often beneficial to put every spare penny you have and put it on the mortgage instead of other investments.  If you can reduce a 25 year mortgage down to 10 years then you will save a ton of money on the mortgage.

Then, there are 30 years of inflation to account for. \n\nThen there is the big, but in some ways less obvious one: opportunity cost, or what the bank *could* do with the money if they didn't loan it to you. For example, investing money for 30 years, you could *easily* double it with historic rates of return, and the bank can't do that if they money just went to buy you a house. On the other hand, if you have good credit, the risk profile for you paying them back is typically much better than the stock market, which is again, part of why having a good credit score lowers interest rates. \n\nSo the bank factors in all those things, plus a bit more on top as profit, and that's how they arrive at a mortgage rate.

I could instead put your $100 in my own money market account and I will get the $5 instead of you.  Given that, would you say it's fair that I get to take your $100 and after, say, 30 years then I give you back $100 and we are good?\n\nThat would allow me to collect $5 x 30 = $150, and then I gave you back your $100 and we are square.\n\nThere is also the chance that I take your $100 and I give nothing back.  So keep this in mind as well.\n\nNo bank would ever allow this.  They would want the $5/y themselves on this money, MINIMUM.  That doesn't even account for the fact that you might try to get out of paying the $100 back.\n\nIn reality, they might charge $6/y to borrow that $100, to account for the fact that there is no risk if they just put their $100 in their own money market account for $5/y and they don't let me borrow anything.\n\nSo I will borrow the $100 and pay $6/y for the privilege of borrowing their $100 and at the end of 30y, I will pay back the whole $100.\n\nStructuring a loan this way (it's called a balloon loan, and it exists), I will pay $280 total over this 30 years.\n\nIn exchange, I will get $100 immediately and I will benefit from whatever I can do with that money for 30 years.  If I use it wisely, I might get more than $280 of total value out of that initial $100 I borrowed.  If I use it unwisely, I could be hurting for quite a long time as a result.\n\nAmortization loans are more complex, but it's the same basic idea.  In either situation, you are paying money to the people you borrowed it from in order to make it worth it for them to let you borrow the money in the first place.  In either situation, this extra (called interest) is what makes it worth it for someone to take a risk on lending you money.\n\nIn individual to individual transactions, the lender often forgives the interest as a personal favor.  Mortgage lenders will never do this.\n\nIn reality, banks additionally use the interest to pay their expenses.  They have rent to pay on their buildings, they have workers to pay, they have power bills to pay, they have documentation expenses to pay, and many other things.   Interest has to include amounts to pay for these things in addition to the other factors I mentioned above.\n\nTLDR, interest is a necessary evil and it ensures you don't profit wildly completely at someone else's expense.  At least not at scale.  It ensures someone else is getting fair compensation when they are doing you the favor of letting you borrow money.\n\nAll professional lending no matter the flavor will follow this sort of concept.",

Mortgage companies want to make money, but if the inflation rate is is 2% and they charge 2% every year, they loaned it to you for free.

I’m making numbers up, don’t come at me if these figures for what banks charge month over month are incorrect. It’s to illustrate a point. \n\nSo generally banks charge an APY or annual percentage rate. This means that at the beginning of every year you are charged 5% on your principle. This means that first year, you owe 105,000$ you pay 500 a month for 12 months paying a total of 6000$.

By the time you save up enough money to buy the house outright, the price has increased dramatically. It's a moving target. That's why I consider the advice to \"never buy unless you have at least 20%\" to be bad advice. You'll pay extra to have mortgage insurance if you pay something like only 5-10% down, but it will be less than waiting a few years and wasting that much more money on paying a higher price.\n\nAlso, unless you're living with your parents rent-free, you're also paying a significant amount to live *somewhere*. My house payment (including taxes and insurance) is about $1,500 a month. If we had rented this same house, it would probably be around $2,500 a month. So, I may only be paying about $200 in principal every month (leaving the remaining $1,300 to pure expense), but that's still a hell of a lot cheaper than renting.",

Then next month you pay $98.7 to interest and $1.3 to principal.\n\nEssentially the bank wants their risk to pay off first... It doesn't matter if your rate is 1% or 20% the structure will be that largely the same and  the majority of the duration of the loan is structured in such a way that the interest or risk is the very thing that gets paid back first or the most.\n\nIf anything happens and you mess up, they obvi take and sell your home to recoup their initial investment of $100,000. \n\nEven if you had a 1% interest rate, due to compounding you will still spend about $16,000 on interest over 30 years which obviously not a straight 1% interest. The difference between 1 and 2 % is over double the interest over the life of the loan at around 33K owed. and is now a third of the home value.\n\nInterest rates CAN be any amount but the are what they are because of course they can be... and even twice the amount isnt good enough... If a person was willing and it did happen to them the could be stuck in an adjustable rate and they would end up paying even more obscene prices for homes.\n\nso in the 80s it was at one point 16% so 100k at 16% will make you pay 384k in interest!\n\nThere are a lot of factors like property tax, price of the home, length, interest rates where that figure is more than half. For example if you buy a severely overvalued home, with a high interest rate you could end up paying quadruple its actual value or more... Meaning under no conditions would you ever be able to extract the value of that home ever... Youd only be able to nullify it by living in it forever to offset the period of mortgage to no mortgage but it would be an endeavor consuming your whole life, for nothing..\n\nHonestly paying double for a home, in my opinion is getting off pretty easy, even with how scummy it is anyway.\n\na 200k home loan at 2% puts you at 739 a month with only 66K interest paid should be the standard as it falls in line with most peoples wages and fits criteria for safely purchasing a home but we dont live in that world.\n\nHoses went up in value BECAUSE the interest compounds faster.. so that same 200k at 2% loan generates only 33% total interest on 200k\n\nwhereas a 500k home at 2% generates 166k which is still 33% overall, it looks like nothing change yet in comparison to the  first example it generated two and a half times more interest!\n\nWe can all point to a home built in  the 70s or 80 or whenever really that had a home value of 200k who now is worth 500k even though the home is largely exactly the same, yet its ability to generate 2.5 times more interest payments out of thin air is suspect....

        "comment_body": "Yes this is normal. IIRC the equal point on a 30yr mortgage is like 5.2%\n\nSo if you have a 30y mortgage at ~5.2% you end up paying equal parts principal and interest over the life of the loan assuming no principal payments. Another way of saying that is the total amount paid is double the principal.\n\nI'd say a few things to keep in mind though:\n1. Most people don't have the discipline to save up for a 100% cash buy. Plus the time it takes to save while paying for other housing assumed to be rented is an opportunity cost possibily against saving for cash buy..\n2. Prices are almost always appreciating so while you save up to minimize interest expenses the houses are getting more and more expensive. That's net worth you are foregoing if you're not already a home owner. I believe the long term average appreciation is about 5%, so nearly a wash depending on the interest rate\n3. Leverage. When you buy a house for let's say 10% down, you only put up 10% of the money. When you account for total payments, appreciation, other expenses (insurance, taxes, maint etc), you're ROI on the house is based on how much you've put in vs how much you get back upon sale. If you sell after let's say 6 years, the ROI may be better for a 10% DP vs a total cash buy. This is much more relevant for investment properties but can apply to personal housing as well.",

Renting can be just as expensive (if not more) than a mortgage - the only difference is that after 30 years of paying off a mortgage, you have a house. After 30 years of renting, you've got nothing. House prices usually increase rather than decrease, so buying a house early means you can buy it for cheaper. It also means that when you sell the house, the value of house will have risen, so you can actually sell it for more than you bought it.",

        "comment_body": "Wait! I'm seeing decent number of bad answers on here, and a lot of almost-right-but-still-kinda-wrong answers.\n\nYou're right that the 7% is your **annual** interest rate. When you take out a $200,000 loan, you'll be required to pay 7% interest on that amount each year. Banks used to offer interest-only loans where you could just pay that $14,000 each year and then be required to pay off or re-finance the property at the end of a certain period of time. But when house prices went down in the 2008 financial crisis, people couldn't re-finance the amount they owed on those loans, and many people defaulted on their loans. As a result, few or no banks in the US offer interest-only mortgages these days.\n\nSo in order to eventually pay off the loan, you can't just make interest payments, you have to make payments towards the principal (i.e., how much of the original loan amount you still owe) as well.\n\nIn theory, one could make a fixed principal payment every month. If you want to pay off a $200K loan in 30 years, you'd need to pay $556 towards principal each month (200,000 / 360). On your very first payment, you'd also need to pay the amount of interest you owe for that portion of the year. On 7% annual interest, you pay one twelfth of that interest in one month, or $1,167 interest. The sum of interest and principal would be $1,723.\n\nBut for Month 2, since you've now paid back $556 towards principal, you now only owe $199,444. Since you owe less, you pay less interest on that amount, and you would pay about $4 less in interest, $1,163 and Month 2's payment would be $1,719.\n\nThe nice thing about that fixed-principal payment model is that your payments go down as you pay off your loan. The problem with that is, for most people, their earnings increase as they get older, and money becomes less valuable due to inflation. So it would be better to back-load how much they pay, or perhaps just fix the total amount, so it's easier to plan into a budget.\n\nThere's a mathematical formula that determines what fixed total payment we could make each month and pay off our remaining principal with our last payment. For a $200K mortgage at 7% interest, you'd pay $1,330 per month for 30 years. You can see that that's less than the $1,723 you'd have to pay for your first payment of a fixed-principal repayment plan, so it's easier for most people. But since it pays less principal up front, you'll end up paying more in interest on that plan.\n\n\n\nAs for why people finance purchases instead of saving. I'm sure you can see the value of buying a house earlier in your life and paying interest, rather than saving your entire life and buying a house towards the end of your life (and meanwhile paying rent to landlords the entire time).",

(X% divided by 7, multiply Y Years by 7)   \nLikewise if population grows at 70% then population will double in 1 year. (% x10, Y /10)  \n\nSame for reduction in value.  \nIf an item's value is reducing by 3.5% a year then it will take 20 years to halve. (7% /2, 10Y x2)\n\nUnderstanding this makes a lot of questions simple.  \nLike \"Is my city increasing utilities and services at the same rate?\", \"Can I afford this?\", \"How many years will it take for crime to actually double if it continues at this rate?\", \"Why is 7% inflation so bad?\".\n\nNow to make this answer relatable to your question, it is easy to calculate what you would earn if you saved an amount at a certain interest rate.  \n\nIf you invested 100,000 at a 3.5% it would take 20 years for your principal to be enough for your 200k home.  \nBut what if home values are increasing at 3.5% a year?   Then you will never have enough.  \nThe home value will reach 400k in those 20 years.  \n\nBut what if interest rates are *lower* than the home value growth rate?  \nLet's say you can get an interest only loan at 1%, and homes are increasing at 7%.   \nWith what we know, it would take the principal of the loan 70 years to double (if you were somehow magically not required to make a payment until the final amount was due), but the house value would double in 10.  \n\nSo with that in mind, our easy calculations lets us realise it's *cheaper* in the long run to get a loan based on current house value growth.  \nYou're buying at \"now\" prices by paying for a loan with a total cost that will be a lot less than \"future\" price.  \n\nFor a reference, from 1997 to 2006, avg.

        "comment_body": "Another component worth considering is the rates.\n\nIf you get a low interest rate like 2-3%, you actually *shouldn't* pay anything but the minimum payment if you can have that money grow elsewhere.\n\nRight now, I have a high yield savings account that grows my money at a rate of 4.5%. So without doing a thing, its growing at a rate faster than I would lose it, paying my minimum payments on my mortgage. Its better to have the majority of my money in that savings account, rather than as equity in my house. So even though I *can* pay waaaay more than the minimum payments on my house, it actually doesn't make financial sense to do it. I can just have it sit in my savings account and let it grow, set up auto payments on my mortgage from that account and pay the minimum. And the money will grow faster than I would pay in interest on the mortgage.\n\nAnd if you get into looking at things like Index funds, even more so. The average rate of return of money in the S&P500 has been between 8-12% since Obama's economy. You know how people keep telling you that the economy is actually doing really well(even though it doesn't feel like it for most people)? Its because of metrics like this. People who have had their money in the market since Obama recovered our economy after the housing market crash in 2008, have been doing REALLY well in their savings. 401k, Roth IRA, Index Funds. These kinds of funds have been growing at an insane rate for the past decade and a half. \n\nAnd I would say, its not too late to get into the market at all. Especially if you're young. The compound growth of money you put in your 20s and 30s is absolutely fascinating and I don't think many young people realize it and I don't think its taught nearly as much as it should.\n\nLets say you're 18 years old and over the course of 1 year, you put $1200.00 away in a Index fund($100 a month). By the time you're 60, at a conservative rate of 8% every year, that investment for ONE year would compound itself to $30,407.38.\n\nYou may say to yourself: well fuck, that's 42 years of my life for only $30k. Not worth it. But lets recall, that's just *one year* of saving $100 a month. Lets blow that out to every month of your life - $100 going to an Index fund. By the time you're 60, if you consistently save $100 a month, it would grow to $395,499.61. And mind you, that's at a conservative rate of 8%(and assuming you're only putting in $100 once a month which is pretty light). At 12% return, that number looks more like $1,297,299.14. Mind you, the rate of return in 2023 for the S&P500 was 26.21%. \n\nSo an 18 year olds \"dream\" of being a millionaire is achievable by anyone that's willing to put away $100 a month(and obviously much faster and more safely, if you're willing to put in more than $100). It saddens me that more people don't realize this. In fact, when I was a kid, before we had access to the internet, my contemporaries convinced me that putting money into a 401k or any retirement savings was a scam. We just didn't know at the time and we didn't have access to tools like the internet to educate ourselves. I wish I knew, at 18, what I know now. It gets MUCH harder to save later in live just because you cant take advantage of compound growth as much.",

A 200k home at 5% interest with no money down and no other costs accounted for will cost $1,100 each month. You'll need to save for about 182 months, or about 15 years to get your money saved up. 15 years ago was 2009.

So if you'd started saving in 2002, knowing that you'd need to account for the extra money that inflation would cost you, you'd actually need ~$350,000 to buy that house. \n\nWell that's another $57k you need to save, so 51 more months, ~4 more years. That means you needed to start saving in 1998. I bet you can see where this is going? You need ~$37k more to account for the inflation (~$387k house price now), so 33 more months (3 years). That brings you to $413,000 you needed to save. But you're getting there, now you only need an extra $26k, so just a mere 2 years. But of course, that brings the inflation adjusted house price to ~$436k and so on and so forth ad nauseam.\n\nIn fact at this point (needing to start saving in 1993) you're already longer than a 30 year mortgage, and you've saved/paid well over the $380k that you would have paid between principal and interest on the mortgage over that time.",

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n> \n> But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.",

The system has valves in veins that act like gates to prevent back-flow and keep blood moving in the right direction. Your heart's pumping action ensures pressure stays high enough to move blood through the body, but not so high that it causes damage.\n\nWhen you get a cut, your body doesn’t need to reconnect every loop because blood flows through the many parallel pathways. When one path is damaged, blood can reroute through others, and the body quickly repairs the broken vessels by clotting to prevent further blood loss. So the big closed loop is flexible and adaptable through parallel blood vessels, and it is not a single rigid pipe.",

Instead of thinking of it as a loop, think of it as a network.\n\nLet's use roads as an analogy. You have major highways, surface boulevards and avenues, and quiet neighborhood roads. The major highways are your major blood vessels, your surface boulevards and avenues are your smaller blood vessels, and the quiet neighborhood roads are your smallest capillaries. \n\nIn the same way that cars don't just circle around on highways but go to and from their destinations on all sizes of roads, your blood also moves through various parts of your network of blood vessels. \n\nWhen a major highway is closed to traffic, cars just take a detour. Our circulatory system is similar, so our blood just takes a detour. Much like a car might get off at an earlier exit on the highway and take surface streets to its destination, if there's a cut or say an amputation, blood just takes a different route around the network just like a car might take a detour. For example, if I need to cross a river and the bridge is closed, I can just drive up a bit to the next closest bridge and cross there. \n\nAs to avoiding back-flows and pressure, your heart keeps your arteries pressurized, and your veins have a series of valves that keep blood moving and in the right direction, assuming everything is working right.",

While much of the \"stuff\" will be picked up again and transferred to the venules (the tiny veins that pick up blood after it goes through the capillaries) a lot of fluid and stuff ends up elsewhere. That's why the body also has the lymphatic system, which has two functions. First it at as a sort of storm drain for excess fluid and cellular debris, carrying fluid back towards the heart for recirculation (about 15% of the fluid pumped out through your arteries goes back to the heart through the lymphatic system rather than your veins), with lymph nodes along the way that sort of functions like sewage plants.

If you have visible veins in your arms you can see this by pressing down on one and sliding along one way, and doing the same the other way, and see which way squeezes blood out and which way it refills behind your sliding finger.\n\n\nOne important thing I want to add is that mammals have two big loops: one powered by the left side of your heart from there to the body and back, and one (at lower pressure) powered by the right side of your heart from there to the lungs and back. This means that your lungs can be more delicate, and hence better at doing the gas exchange they need, than if they had to operate at body blood pressure.",

Surgeons have nothing to do with the part where you are prepared for surgery. \n2nd: the true mechanism for how inhaled anesthetic drugs work is not actually known. We have several theories, but none proven in humans. We only know that they do work. \n3rd: there are ways, in a manner, to know how deep your anesthetic state is, but its not a standard if care, and not routinely used. \n\nEssentially, anesthesia providers have years of experience, and do everything possible to ensure that a patient doesn’t remember their surgery. Essentially it works like this, studies were done to find out how much anesthesia gas is required so that half of all patients donet remember anything. This is called MAC awake. Or the minimum alveolar concentration of an anesthetic gas so that half of patients dont remember anything. Which is roughly 0.6% of exhaled sevoflurane (the most commonly used anesthetic gas). However the amount of gas required to prevent half the population from moving after a standard surgical stimulus is around 2.1%. Most of the time we use about 2.2-2.5% of sevoflurane, plus other drugs that cause amnesia and narcotics. We can be confident that no one is going to remember anything. \n\nIn my 13 years of anesthetic practice i have never had a single case of awareness under anesthesia. So the process works. But its much more of an art, than it is a science. The US national average is 1 to 2 cases per 1000.",

The \"stop you from moving\" drug is exactly that, if you move around during surgery bad things can happen.\n\nThe \"destroy your memory\" drug was added because sometimes the \"stop your movement\" drug worked, but the \"put you to sleep\" drug did not.  This third drug inhibits forming memories.  You won't remember being awake and aware and feeling every cut as they slice into your body.\n\nSince they added the third drug malpractice suits have gone down.  Maybe you were in immense pain, and were unable to move or speak to inform anybody, but you won't remember it after the surgery.  Now the anesthesiologist  needs to screw up administering 2 out of 3 drugs for you to remember anything.\n\nIn actuality, the \"paralyzed but feeling everything\" thing rarely ever happened.  But now it's rarer still.  An anesthesiologist is in the room the whole time while you're under, and they're monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, etc.  They're highly trained, and it would take a major screwup for them not to notice your heart rate spiking whenever the surgeon starts cutting.  In fact, I only ever heard of the \"woke up and started feeling everything but couldn't move or speak\" to have happened during heart surgery, when the anesthesiologist  would be expecting an erratic heartbeat and blood pressure.\n\nPS: The \"destroy your memory\" drug was often Rohypnol, aka \"roofies\" aka \"the date rape drug\".",

Obviously, that would happen to a person too, but part of the anesthesiologist's job is to counter those side effects. General anesthesia very often *does* stop people from breathing. Even if a patient has some drive to breathe in their very deeply unconscious state, the anesthesiologist often needs to use a paralytic to prevent any movement from disrupting the procedure, which paralyzes the breathing muscles too. So it's standard to place a breathing tube and have a ventilator breathing for them the entire time. Your vital signs are also watched very closely during the procedure, so that extra fluids or even other medicines can be given to maintain a safe blood pressure. Managing all of that is part of the anesthesiologist's job before, during, and after the surgical procedure.",

I was high as a kite for about a week. \n\nI know nurses deal with a lot of shitty attitudes as they are dealing with people that are scared, in pain and out of their comfort zone, so I tried to be as kind and a little of burden as possible.\n\nOne night, I had to ping my nurse like 2x in 15 minutes and apologized for bugging her again. She was like, \"Nah, you're an angel. I don't mind coming in here.\"\n\nHigh me was like :')!\n\nThe next shift, my new nurse helped me, and I was just being kind, and he was like, \"Oh, they weren't kidding about you being a good patient. I thought they were being sarcastic and was worried.\n\nHigh me was like :')!!\n\nMy final day, my last nurse was a large LARGE black man. I'm 6'2\"at 180, and this man was easily 6'5\" at 230 lbs. He needed me to poop or else he had to manually put a pill up my butt.\n\nWhen the constitution said we had the right to bear arms, this man took it literally and had bear paws for hands. I looked at his bratwurst sized fingers, then at the pill, and was like...by chance is there a nurse with smaller hands?\n\nHe laughed and said, \"Where is the fun in that?\"\n\nLet me tell you, my booty understood the danger it was in.

They gave me some local anaesthetic with long needles into my chest cavity and when it came time to give me the general sedative, the surgeon notably said, \"Well there's no way I'm giving him that much. It'll kill him\". That's when I knew it was going to be trouble. They weren't even supposed to put me under, but I'd been through a few procedures where it didn't matter because you were so looped out you couldn't feel a thing.\n\nI had been in the hospital for a couple of months that this point and had developed a pretty good tolerance. I plead with the doctor to call my regular doctor to confirm as it wasn't the first time I had heard or seen someone comment on the amounts they were to give me. Well, my doctor man sure didn't like 17 year old me calling his decision into question. At that point he became visibly perturbed and his comments were more combative than kind.\n\nMy mother was in the procedure room with me while they did the endoscopy. She was a trooper who held my hand and tried to offer comfort through the process which was supposed to be be (relatively) pain free. From the moment they inserted the camera, I was commenting that I could feel it. That I could feel everything and that it hurt and was getting worse. The level of pain only increased with every inch that the camera was inserted and the feeling of it inside was like someone twisting a knife in your guts. I was crying at first, but the cries soon turned into screams. The doctor was yelling at me to be quiet and stop moving, but it was impossible not to squirm a little at the very least. Just as the doctor was most frustrated by the screaming I began to dry heave from the pain.\n\nSo here's the scenario at this point. I'm screaming in pain and dry heaving as my body is jumping involuntarily off the table. The doctor is screaming at me to stay still and my mother was gripping my hand and balling her eyes out at the scene in front of her. That's how the rest of the procedure went. I wish I could say it went quick, but it didn't. It was a half hour of pure torture that seemed like days.\n\nThe people that put you under are called anaesthesiologists. They are very good at what they do and are very specialized in this area. A surgeon or GP is typically not. When someone is not good at inducing the anaesthetic state and wants to second guess another doctor without consultation, you wind up with the shit show that I went through.\n\nI learned early in life that not all doctors are a credit to their profession. That even highly trained and top ranked doctors can succumb to their own egos. That second opinions are the very least you should seek out. There were a couple of doctors who did the least they could do for me and it damn near killed me. But nobody put me through the agony that that asshole did.",

They felt the pain. They experienced it with the full extent of what we all know of as “pain”, and all the harm that comes with it.\n\nBut a human that’s under anaesthetic is a different thing altogether. You can absolutely have a body move and respond to noxious stimuli, while the person who inhabits that body experiences no “pain”.\n\nUltimately, experiencing awareness during anesthesia can mean many things. You can be fully aware but feel no pain. You can be completely unaware, but your body many respond to the “pain” and trigger physiological responses. You can sit anywhere in between, be partially aware, partially able to feel pain, etc. \n\nIt’s extremely, extremely, *extremely* rare to be both cognizant and feeling the pain from surgery in a meaningful way. \n\nFun fact - general anaesthetic is actually a cocktail of drugs to impact different parts of your brain. You need the “sleepy” drug to get rid of consciousness, you need an analgesic to reduce pain sensation and prevent the body from triggering a response, and you need a paralytic to ensure any responses the body does have can’t be translated into movement/the body doesn’t move on it’s own in general. \n\n\nSource: I have chronic nerve pain after accidentally slicing a major nerve in two, and a penchant for reading and research, as well as a few friends who are anesthesiologists.",

My mom’s diamond on her wedding ring isn’t going to break after 25years\n\nDiamonds are damaged all the time through normal wear on jewelry, especially when they're put in a setting that places the stone out in the open like a prong or trellis.\n\nDiamonds chip from impacts all the time, usually from someone hitting something hard, or from rapid temperature changes. Not anything dramatic either, usually just someone waving your hand while talking and hitting something, or regularly going from a cool indoor room to a hot outdoor environment regularly.\n\nDiamonds are **hard**, and what that usually means in materials is that they're also correspondingly **brittle**. Hard materials typically bond in regular planes that sit on one another, and when force is applied they will crack along those planes. \n\nWhat that means is that you're unlikely to scratch a diamond without another diamond (though it can happen rarely), but you can crack it by hitting it too hard against a cheap wooden desk.",

Now remove the diamond and try selling it on the open market (facebook marketplace or whatever).  You'll be lucky to get $100 for it.\n\n\"Large\" diamond's - the kind of thing you get in jewellery -  are pretty much worthless and are only used in jewellery. Diamonds become expensive, as you've implied, due to supply restrictions and the acceptance of people to pay inflated prices. So it's in the jewellery market that they find themselves being used again.\n\nSmaller diamonds, especially diamond powder, have industrial use and are unsurprisingly cheap at around $50 for 5 carats, compared to, errrmmmm, a sh\\*t ton of money for a whole diamond (about $50,000 for 5 carats, depending on how it's been graded).",

Secondly, people think that diamonds are rare, when the reality is that they aren't - at least not the common ones (more on that below).\n\nThe scarcity of diamonds is a marketing ploy entirely orchestrated by De Beers, the world's largest diamond mining company, to keep prices artificially high. They have a quasi-monopoly, which is why diamonds are so expensive.\n\nThus, the price you pay for a diamond far exceeds its actual value, which is why diamonds are a terrible investment and their resale value generally sucks.\n\nHowever, the above applies only to common diamonds, the kind you'll find in most jewelry, regardless of brand, and weighing up to 1 carat. Diamonds of exceptional size and clarity and naturally colored diamonds are much rarer and retain significantly more resale value than the standard variety.\n\nFor instance, diamonds weighing between 1 and 2 carats are rare, but not so rare that they'll hold their value upon resale. They're the bread and butter of the engagement ring industry, led by companies such as Tiffany's, for instance. Diamonds above 3 carats are considered luxury items because flawless diamonds of this weight are very rare in nature. Anything above 5 carats is exceedingly rare and sought after by high-end jewelers (Cartier, etc.) for very high-end pieces.",

Just give it a cleaning, and voila.\n\nSecondly, I *could* sell you my old diamonds, but how do either of us know what quality it is? Think about any heirloom diamond ring, no one has paperwork for the cut/clarity/carats from 60 years ago, and laymen like us don't have a way to test or prove what it is. How would I know if it's worth $500 or $5,000? This I think is the primary reason diamonds end up back in the hands of jewelers. They have the means to verify what the diamond is. \n\nAnd jewelers are a centralized source of demand.

When it was only aristocrats buying them, they stayed in possession of those families too, so they didn't always enter the broader market.  \n\nKeep in mind that *good* natural diamonds are one part of it, you also needed capable craftspeople to cut them by hand, and that itself is an evolving art form.  So the supply of modern styled diamonds is just not that big.  \n\nPrior to the advent of dynamite in the 1860s mining anything was quite difficult at scale, so large scale extraction of anything is only really one and a bit centuries old.  \n\nAnd then everyone has been told they should have diamonds  so demand dramatically increased.  A perhaps interesting thought it what will happen as all the people born in the 1930's and 40s and 50s die off and their 'middle class' diamonds end up in the market, but a lot of those cut diamonds might not be hugely attractive to modern consumers.\n\nEdit:  Gold production has essentially the same argument, https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/200-years-of-global-gold-production-by-country/  the really large widescale extraction starts post WW1 and WW2 when there's  a large scale supply of modern stable explosives.",

She has always loved genuine antique jewelry. It's pretty much impossible to have a truly *antique* lab-grown diamond, since the technology to create them didn't even exist at all until after WWII. True gem-quality lab diamonds didn't come around until the 70s, and it wasn't until the 80s that it started to really become practical. So, if she wants an antique diamond...natural is literally the only option.\n\nSecond, and much more practical, is that because of social perceptions regarding lab-grown diamonds, they have much lower resale value. This is, naturally, not much of a concern if you intend to keep a given diamond within the family. For those who don't plan to do so, however, or who see it as an investment in future generations once the owner has died, lab-grown stones may not be as desirable as natural stones.\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that *I* don't care about either of these things. If a hypothetical boyfriend were to propose to me with a lab-grown stone, there's only one requirement I have: *don't pretend it's something it's not.* I couldn't give an airborne coitus if it's natural vs man-made, but it is still dishonest to *pretend* that it is a natural stone if it isn't (or vice-versa, but as there's zero benefit for pretending it's lab-grown, I expect that's pretty rare.)",

From someone on Craig'sList?  At least with a jewelry store, they have a bit more to lose if they sell you a fake.

Diamonds the size of a BB pellet or smaller are as common as dirt and they are worth nothing. Other gemstones can be more or less common but in general they're not that rare and those that can also be made artificially are worth even less. Ruby for example is very common and can be made super easily even in gigantic sizes (think of crystals whose weight is not measured in carats but in KILOGRAMS) so they're all basically worthless as a gem. You can make a a ruby the size of an apricot in an afternoon with an old microwave and a bunch of cheap powders. If you have a 8K gold ring with a 10 carats ruby, the gold in the alloy of the ring is most likely worth more than the gemstone, market wise.",

This is, naturally, not much of a concern if you intend to keep a given diamond within the family. For those who don't plan to do so, however, or who see it as an investment in future generations once the owner has died, lab-grown stones may not be as desirable as natural stones.\n\n\nI went ring shopping not long ago, and the math just doesn't check out. If a natural diamond from a dealer costs $10,000, then the equivalent lab-grown one would cost $2,000. Reselling a diamond typically gets you up to 50% of its brand new value. Even if the lab diamond were completely worthless at $0 resale value, you'd have been financially better off buying the lab diamond.\n\n* Net value after buying and reselling natural diamond: -$5,000\n* Net value after buying and throwing the lab diamond away: -$2,000\n\nThis is before accounting for the opportunity cost of locking up $8,000 in a rock, which could have been used to pay down debts, put towards a house down payment, or been invested in the stock market.\n\n\nEven then, getting any non-trivial difference in value back assumes future generations care whether a diamond is natural or lab grown. I'm at the age where everyone is getting married, and not a single person I know of has chosen a natural diamond. It's actually a bit looked down upon, from what I've seen.",

Modern diamonds are cut much more precisely with machines, while diamonds used to be cut by hand, meaning they had fewer cuts that were less precise and symmetrical. The kind of cuts people achieve today simply were not possible.\n\nBasically, people just want diamonds to be as sparkly as possible, so the more cuts you can jam in the better. It all reflects against each other and makes more rainbows.\n\nThis is not unique to diamonds, moissanite isn't typically rose cut or old mine cut these days either.",

        "comment_body": "Sharpening works by removing material from a knife to form a V-shaped edge using something harder than the blade. You can actually use a brick or the bottom of a coffee mug to sharpen a knife since they're both harder than steel. A common abrasive in sharpening stones is aluminum oxide, the same kind you see in sandpaper, and that works for most knives. But certain types of steel alloys are really, really hard compared to an average kitchen knife, and trying to sharpen a knife made out of an alloy like S110V using normal stones can be incredibly slow. \n\nThat's where diamonds come in! \"Stones\" are made using a bunch of similarly sized diamonds (for consistency, also like sandpaper) that can make sharpening even the hardest steels so much faster than aluminum oxide.\n\nDiamond stones can be coated which is when they're electroplated to a metal backing plate. They can also be bonded, meaning the diamonds are suspended in another softer material, usually some kind of proprietary resin. Coated stones are the most aggressive, they produce the deepest scratches and remove material more quickly which is why they're great for setting the initial edge with coarser diamonds (50-250 microns). Metallic- and resin-bonded stones are more gentle because the diamonds are sunk into the surface of the stones which make them excellent choices for putting a finishing touch on an edge with finer diamonds (1-80 microns). They're also more expensive and wear out more quickly than coated stones.\n\nThere are other abrasives used in sharpening too, like silicon carbide, cubic boron nitride, and different types of natural stones mined all over the world (e.g. Arkansas stones which I *think* are quartz).\n\nDiamonds are also used for stropping, which is the last step in sharpening and done to put a hair whittling edge on a knife. You spray an emulsion of extremely fine diamonds (as small as 0.1 microns) onto a flat surface such as leather, wood, or even denim glued to wood and let it dry. Stropping is great for removing the microscopic burr that often forms at the very end of the edge, which can dull your knife when it breaks.\n\nDiamonds are cool.",

There are better methods that rely on the carry over heat from the walls and the washed items themselves. This works very well as long as there is enough air exchange. European dishwashers have done so for at least half a century, and even American dishwashers are catching up. \n\n\nSo, these days, the warning about using the top has become less relevant. And even if your dishwasher still has a heated dry cycle, you can usually disable it in the menu and then use the bottom rack. I've done so many times. Works just fine and won't damage plastics",

Since the invention of the dishwasher until about the last 5 to 10 years, one of the main selling points of using a dishwasher was that it heated the water much much hotter than your tap could provide, or that you could safely use for hand washing. This resulted in a better cleaning and better sanitization. Pretty much every dishwasher made until a few years ago used a heating element to heat the water. These heating elements could also be used  to heat the air during a drying cycle if the user desired.\n\nIn recent years, due to drives for greater efficiency on consumer appliances, these heating elements have been removed (since electric resistive heating is extremely energy inefficient). With more modern detergents, we are able to get similar cleaning performance from lower temperatures (we've seen a similar trend in a clothes washers, where most detergents do not require hot water to be effective). So now the Hot water coming from your tap is sufficiently hot. On modern dishwashers like this, there is no heating element at all. To achieve a dry cycle, they use a process called \"condensation drying\" (I describe it in more detail in another post in this comment chain). \n\nSo yes, dishwashers ARE connected to a hot water tap. And many new washers use only this hot water with no additional heating. But for most of the existence of dishwashers, they used a heating element to get the water much hotter than tap water. Modern designs have stopped doing this for energy efficiency reasons, and if so they toss the heating element entirely, and use a different (usually less effective) method to dry the dishes.",

That HAS been a growing trend in newly manufactured washers over recent years. Many of them are no longer sold with heating elements. You are correct about that.\n\n However, you are incorrect that they still use heating elements to dry the dishes. Electric resistive heating is very energy inefficient, and using it to dry the dishes would pose the exact same energy efficiency problems as using them to heat the water would. Dishwashers that have dropped the heating element no longer use a heating element to dry the dishes, they use a system usually referred to as \"condensation drying\". This uses hot water for the final rinse to heat the dishes up, and then the stainless steel walls of the chamber are chilled (sometimes just by circulating cold water around it, other times through the use of a small efficient compression refrigeration system). So with the walls of the chamber being at a much lower temperature than the recently hot-rinsed dishes, The humidity in the air will preferentially condense on the walls of the washer, instead of the dishes. This is a much more energy efficient solution, and also has the benefit of allowing you to place plastic anywhere in the washer. However, it is generally much much less effective at drying dishes (And it's much more common to find dishes, especially plastic dishes with a very low thermal conductivity, That have some water droplets left on them after the drying cycle). \n\nSo no, dishwashers that have stopped using a heating element to heat the water do NOT till use a heating element to heat the air to dry them. Or at least none that I am aware of. It's possible someone designed and sold one to that functioned that way, but it would be pretty stupid as there's no real benefit from an efficiency standpoint. If a dishwasher has a heating element, it will be used to both heat the water and dry the dishes. If a dishwasher does not use a heating element to heat the water, it almost certainly does not have any other heating element for drying the dishes or any other purpose.",

Using a heating element to heat the water above the hot water tap's temp uses energy. By no longer doing this, they save energy. This is more efficient. Also, I was referencing that ohmic/resistive heating is much less efficient than other means of heating can be (i.e. generating heat vs transporting it from elsewhere). One of my professors explained it as burning money to generate heat. Yes, it works, and it's effective, but if you're clever you can use that money to do some things that result in things getting  lot warmer.

Yes, ohmic (resistive) heating is 100% energy efficient, in the sense that if you input 20W of power, you get 20W of heating. However it will take a LOT of electricity to resistive heating toheat up a substantial amount of water and evaporate it (i.e. to dry dishes). However when it comes to thermal systems, you do not always need to GENERATE heat directly, but merely transport it from one place to another. This can be done with much greater than 100% efficiency. So in absolute terms, it is inefficient to dry dishes this way (it uses a lot of electricity to do so) and in relaitve terms, ohmic heating is inefficient because there are other systems that can cause the same temperature rise using much less electricity).\n\nYou've largely mis-read or misunderstood my posts. I'm not going to bother to try and parse it all out or correct it here. But you can look this up for yourself. Google something like \"why did dishwashers stop using heating elements\" or similar. Read the results. They'll all say the same thing. Which will be what I wrote above, namely: Diswashers originally included heating elements to heat the water to a temp ABOVE what your house water heater could provide (and above what you could safely use for hand-washing without burning yourself). Recently, many have stopped doing this, in order to meet more stringent efficiency requirements. They now no longer need to heat the washing water to such high temps (due to more modern detergents), so eliminated a heated drying cycle to save on energy used.",

So, a heart attack/ stroke wasn't a 0% chance without daylight savings time.  In fact, it was maybe going to happen at the next \"disruption.\"  But, that loss of an hour of sleep is the disruption, so they all happen THAT day. \n\nYou also might begin to feel that an hour less sleep than usual is a big deal as you age.  The joke that at 22 you can have 7 drinks and sleep on the floor and wake up after 6 hours and go for a run, and at 42 you sleep with the wrong pillow and you are sore for 3 days is kind of true! \n\nThen, with kids.  It is easy to say, \"Just adjust!\"  But kids are not rational like that!  They don't sleep in because the clock \"fell back.\"  So, if they were waking up at 6, they are now waking up at 5!  If they were going to bed at 7, they are now getting cranky and fussy at 6 PM.  In the meantime, your work schedule is still 8:30 to 5, so dinner is not ready an hour earlier! The end result is that for up to a week, you are dealing with cranky kids for an extra hour each night, and ALSO waking up earlier than usual.  \n\nOn the \"spring forward\" side, you are waking your kid up an hour earlier, and then trying to convince them to go to bed an hour early.  So, for a week, you kid is probably getting a bit less sleep, and you are having either an hour less time free, or less sleep.  \n\nYou can compare it with travel, but unhealthy, older people actually DO complain a TON about travel, avoid it, and it takes them a long time to adjust.

Solar time, your own personal biological (aka circadian) rhythm which differs from person to person (your chronotype), and social time.\n\nMy understanding is the average person naturally wants to be sleeping around 11pm - 7am while on standard time — which is their preferred biological time — give or take an hour depending on the day. And that's assuming an 8 hour duration, but durations vary too, with some needing about 7 hours and some about 9 depending on the day and the person to feel well rested.\n\nThat's the median chronotype for a majority of the population. There are variations in chronotypes however so it differs along a bell curve in the population, but can go from extreme morning larks to extreme night owls. There is mounting evidence that chronotype is genetic and cannot be changed through habit, and naturally aligns with the sun in your locality so that if you move to any location in the world, you will still naturally drift into being a lark, an owl, or closer to the median, wherever you go depending on your natural tendencies.\n\nAge can also be a factor. Teens and young adults tend to skew later than the median, while elderly people tend to skew earlier.\n\nSo anyways, sunlight largely regulates this system — this would be the solar time component — and the median sunlight times that have the best effect on keeping us within the 11pm - 7am sleep range that the median person would have, for example, aligns more closely with standard time.\n\nBut due to social obligations like work we tend to mess around with that. A lot of people will be going to bed an hour or two earlier than the chronotype already (which, again averages at about 11pm - 7am with some variation for the typical person), so they can get more of the morning for prep, gym, commute, whatever. People think they're still getting 8 hours, so they should be good, but studies show that it's not a quality 8 hours if it's out of alignment with your natural chronotype. This is where our biological clocks and social clocks start to really differ.\n\nThis misalignment is a big part of the reason many people who rise early feel more inclined to fall asleep later and wake up later on a weekend where they have nothing to do. That's your body telling you, \"hey, this is is when I would actually like to be sleeping.\" That effect is more pronounced during DST.\n\nDST basically fucks with this even more by making the typical 11pm - 7am median person now a chronotype of 12am - 8am according to the adjusted clock, but with all the same social obligations. And keep in mind, if you're someone that needs 9 hours of sleep to feel properly rested, your biological clock is now going be 12am - 9am. And remember, there's about an hour variation each way, so this median person is going to even have some nights where their body won't feel like sleeping until 1am and will want to sleep in until 9am or 10am daylight time.\n\nSo combine that with people getting up early already to have a bit of time to themselves in the morning, work out, go to work, whatever else, and you actually start to get perhaps actually like 3 or 4 hours of alignment with your chronotype.\n\nIt sucks even more if you're a night owl chronotype since society tends to run earlier than their circadian rhythm. Again keep in mind, it's a bell curve, so around 50% of the population skew towards the night owl part of the spectrum to varying degrees, to either a slight, moderate, or high degree on the curve. This is actually a huge reason why so many people have insomnia. People with insomnia who are night owls, can actually often completely correct it if they're able to adopt a later schedule.\n\nNow, again, people think — I'm still able to fall asleep and get 8 hours, what's the big deal?\n\nWell, it drastically impacts the quality of sleep to be out of your chronotype. It's actually been shown that early risers tend to have lower IQ, but there's evidence that it's not actually because they're stupid but because their sleep is out of phase with their chronotype. There's also evidence to my knowledge that being out of phase with your chronotype for long enough has effects on heart health, memory, hormones, diabetes risk, and a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nNow, if those are the effects of being out of your chronotype chronically, it's probably not hard to see why a sudden shift results in more accidents and heart attacks when you do the shift suddenly. We actually see the reverse when going back to standard time. People are more well rested, have fewer accidents and heart attacks.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

This means, apartments and offices need windows to the outside.\n\nThe problem is that when things get larger the inside grows faster than the surface. So as buildings get wider you get more and more floorspace that's not near the outside wall. And at some points it becomes impossible to have natural light everywhere on the inside.\n\nThe solution: Don't make buildings like big squares but like long rectangles. That way you can get light in from both sides. Of course you can bend those rectangles as well and make a lot of different creative shapes but still narrow enough that you get light in from both sides.\n\nSo instead of a long \"I\" you might bend it to make an \"L\". Then you might bend that again and make a \"U\". And at that point, why not close the shape and make an \"O\"?\n\nIf you want to keep it simple then you can just leave that inside of the \"O\" open to the weather. Classic city blocks work like that. You've got the lot with buildings around the outside and the inside often acts as a shared space for all the neighbors.\n\nBut if the inside of the \"O\" is small enough and all belongs to one building you might also cover it up and get a space that has both natural light AND is protected from the elements.",

So if one team is much better than another, you adjust the odds so that it becomes more attractive to bet on the worse team, until the amount of money on both sides is the same. \n\nIn other situations, the odds are usually set similarly, but there could be objective measures: e.g. the odds of a die rolling a 6 are 6:1, but presumably if people bet on this they would get to the same ratio.",

If the horse wins, for every $1 I initially bet, I will receive $10. In that case, a $10 bet pays $100 and so forth. \n\nHow odds are calculated can get complicated quick, and I don’t fully understand the math and models that the bookmaker uses. But, basically, the bookmaker adjusts payouts such that the action (bets) on both sides cancel each other out and the bookmaker makes a profit off of their fees they charge to facilitate the betting. \n\nLet’s use a hypothetical boxing match as an example, Johnny Johnson vs Chad Chungus. When the betting opens, Chad has odds of 50 to 1. The bettors place a crazy high amount of bets on Chad because they think the payout is worth the risk of him losing. In order to avoid having to payout a large amount of money should Chad win, the bookmaker adjusts the odds down to 20 to 1. This prompts less bets on Chad, which ideally evens out with bets on Johnny.\n\nI hope that helps a bit!",

When odds are low, like 2 to 1, it’s more likely to happen, but you wouldn’t win as much.\n\nHere’s how it works: if you see odds like 3 to 1, it means that for every $1 you bet, you’d win $3 if you’re right. So, if you bet $10, you’d win $30 (plus you get back the $10 you bet).\n\nAnother way of showing odds is with a decimal, like 4.0. To find your payout, you just multiply your bet by this number.

It’s loss if you lose money. \n\nMost businesses are for profit. That means that their primary goal is to bring in more than they pay out. The owners get to keep the difference. Giving the money to the owners isn’t an expense. It’s a dividend or distribution. Even if the money isn’t given back to the owners right away, the owners have a legal right to it eventually. \n\nNonprofits and not for profits don’t give money back to owners. They can make a profit, but the profit is retained and used for the business’s purpose. \n\nThink of a private golf club. Members pay dues to the club. The club may also run a restaurant, where members pay to eat just like a normal restaurant. But after expenses are paid, the money stays with the club and can be used for future expenses (e.g., payroll) or capital improvements (e.g., 8 new holes). This would be not-for-profit. It exists for the benefit of its members as a group, not its owners individually. Any profit is retained by the business.\n\nA nonprofit also doesn’t return money to owners. Think of a charity. Its whole reason for existing is to take in money to use for charitable purposes. It can sell stuff (teddy bears, ribbons, lottery tickets), but its purpose is not to improve itself or serve any owners or members. Its purpose is to use the money to benefit others.\n\nThese are very general terms. In reality, the lines get blurry.

Some are actively bad and skirt the edges of what is legal, some mean well but simply are not good at operating an organization efficiently. \n\nMy Dad made his career by telling non-profits he would save them more than his salary within the first two years and could often do it in the first 6 months. \n\nWhen considering donating to a non-profit it's always a good idea to check their financials to make sure they are making good use of their funds.

Well, the president of the club doesn't get to pocket that cash, or pay it to some shareholder. The club should keep it and spend it on some gaming stuff next year (maybe host 2 big lan parties, or pay someone to buy Discord Nitro to make a nicer discord server, or rent a locker and buy a console that they can bring out during LAN parties for some game variety).\n\nIn constrast, we sometimes do expect people to do things for profit. For instance, if a band has a show, and it cost $10,000 to run the show, but they collected $12,000 is tickets, then we'd probably expect the musicians to pocket that $2000 as profit and perhaps pay some income tax on it. (They don't owe us an extra $2000 worth of ameneties at the next concert, the way the gaming hobby club might have.)\n\n\\----\n\nThe precise rules that regulate these different types of organisation will depend on the laws in your area. But they usually amount to something that mostly aims to captures the spirit of the above examples (but there are likely some edge-cases, perhaps by mistake, or perhaps corruptly placed there, since chances are that no law is perfect).",

The executives could be financially penalized for that as well.\n\nAs others have said, the only things couching this otherwise is the folks who are contributing money to the organization and the board of directors of the company. If the American Cancer Society was paying its CEO $100 million a year, people probably would donate less and it would create negative PR.\n\nTying that together with my first point though, if you lose your tax exempt status people are also less likely to donate to you. \n\nThe wealthy could exploit this, but it's not a terribly tax efficient way to do so because a) you would have to demonstrate some social good to be a tax exempt org, which would cost money, and b) the salaries you are paying people are taxable at normal income rates. A for-profit corporation has plenty of ways to reduce taxable income, and stock-based payouts can be more tax advantaged.",

Sweating is one of the most effective, if not the most effective, heat dissipation technique in any land based animal.\n\nAnother reason is our upright posture, which allows for much more efficient energy use in locomotion, though at the expense of speed that four legged runners can achieve, Edit: just to elaborate on this part, the reason for this is that humans can run while using relatively few muscles compared to other animals. Think about a lion running. What muscles does it use? Its fore and hindlegs, yes, but it's also contracting its body in a wavelike motion to move its hindlegs up and push it's forelegs back. A running lion uses damn near every muscle in its body to achieve speed. Compare that to humans, who can maintain a solid speed without moving anything above our legs.\n\nAnother big one is that the pelvis essentially acts as a bowl for our viscera. A four legged animal has nothing supporting their guts but their belly skin, muscles, and other soft tissues. When they run, this causes their intestines to move about and interfere with breathing. Humans have a solid bone acting as the base for our organs.",

Even Cheetahs can't keep up their speed for very long. \n\nThat is what gave humans an advantage. We were able to better coordinate and thus corral/ambush animals and then were able to chase them down once they were injured.",

        "comment_body": "Human diet evolution is quite fascinating.\n\nHumans probably evolved from a species that closely ressembles modern Chimpanzees. Eating fruits, plants, and insects, but very little meat.\n\nYet, around 2 million years ago, the region of the great African Rift Valley dried up. What was a lush jungle, became a Savanna, bringing large herds like antilope, and their predators like lion. These early humans were not Hunter though, but because their environment changed so drastically, they needed new sources of food.\n\nOne of these was to scavenge for carcasses left by lions. Despite their strong jaws, these animal cannot access all of the bone marrow. But with opposable thumbs, humans could use rocks to break the bones and access bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow is incredibly nutricious, and probably helped our ancestors survive. Early humans probably walked miles and miles to fallow the herds around, and wait for one of the predators to kill an antilope.\n\nThis process took over a million years, and by that point humans and chimpanzees wouldn't look alike anymore.\n\nFirst, humans were no longer arboreal, they didn't depend on trees for shelter or food, and were now adapted to grasslands.\n\nTheir diets consisted mostly of bone marrow when they could scavenge carcasses, as well as aquatic foods, like turtles. After all, cracking a bone with a rock and cracking a turtle open with a rock are not so different. Our digestive tracks would have completely adapted, being more suited for meat, and less for plants for example.\n\nYet, survival of early humans greatly depended on opportunistic food ressources. Grasslands are filled with nutricious plants, mostly cereals, but also roots and legumes. \n\nBasically, these early humans had pretty much adapted to our modern diet of foods at this point, hundreds of thousands of years before fire was mastered.\n\nThe advantages of this diet were very advantageous compared to the ones of most apes. It's very calory dense, and filled with essential amino acids and nutrients. This allowed humans to evolved larger and larger brains, which brought more and more intelligence and social dynamics.\n\nBut the real coup de grace that allowed humans to really take off was fire. Fire allows to \"pre digest\" foods providing more energy and nutriments, it also makes food softer which allowed humans to evolve smaller jaws, providing more space for the brain but also for speech.\n\nFast foward another million year, and we would definitly recognize these early humans as humans. Most of the fur would have disappeared, allowing us to sweat more, and making us more mobile as well. We were also fully bipedal, no longer relying on our forward limbs for mobility, which meant we could carry tools around with us.\n\nSo around 500 thousand years ago, humans had mastered fire and tools. No longer did we bang vulgar rocks on turtles and bones, we now fabricated sophisticated and specialized tools, and one of them would be spears to hunt.\n\nOthers have replied why humans are so good at long distance running, and that's all part of our dietary evolution. Humans needed meats to support their large brains, and their growing communities required lots of it.\n\nAs social creatures, we rapidly specialized our hunting strategies and adapted it to our prey. Humans population began to grow exponentially, and tribes would travel very large distances to follow the herds.\n\nWe simply became the walking kings of the animal kingdom. Carrying our tools and all our gear around. We developped cardio, endurance, and complex communication like spoken language.\n\nOf course, being able to walk long distances, hunt for large herds animal, and scavenge for roots, cereals, and legumes, humans were now perfectly adapted to grasslands. A process that took no less than 2 million years.\n\nWe rapidly walked across the grasslands of the world, reaching regions far from our ancestral homes.",

Its an idea floated in the 80s by one doctoral student that now has about as much evidence for it as there is additional evidence against it that then got picked up by a sports-writer who used this pretense of a revolutionary scientific discovery to hype up his book.\n\nThe idea went viral and now its being spread on the internet as fact, even though its at best conjecture. Its not complete non-scientific horseshit like flat earth, but it certainly isnt proven and it probably is untrue.\n\nAsk yourself a couple of questions:\n\n\\- Can you cover more distance in a day on foot, or on horseback? Obviously on horseback. So how would you hunt a wild horse or a zebra by chasing it until it tires? You wouldnt, because you cant. Humans are neither uniquely endurant, nor are we uniquely fast. We are mid at both.\n\n\\- Lets say you are hunting a smaller animal, like a cat. Can you outrun your house cat? No, you cant. Even if you can continue jogging for longer than the cat can keep your jogging pace, that does not mean you can catch the cat eventually. The cat doesnt need to exist the outmost limit of your jogging range, it just needs to get far enough that you lose sight of it and now you dont know which way to run after it. You will not be on an infinitely wide neatly mowed lawn where you can see everything in every direction for miles, that type of terrain doesnt exist in nature and if it did, animals of prey would avoid it instinctively, because they dont like being visible to predators.\n\n\\- What type of athlete consumes by far the most calories per day per pound of bodyweight? High volume endurance athletes do. The type of lifestyle that enables running for multiple hours in one go will cost you 4000+ calories per day. On the day you actually do run for the whole day, you might burn 6000. You probably could have lived on 2000, if you hunted by lying in wait or by laying of traps and foraged, like a reasonable person in the wilderness would.  \nThat does not even cover the question of water. You cant carry much water on you as a hunter-gatherer, at least not in a way that doesnt impede running. How much water would you drink in half a day of non-stop running? Well, all the water. Ultrarunners have aid stations or complete their distance in multiple loops so they can pick up additional water and food on the way for a reason.\n\n\\- How will you get your food back home? You just spent 4 hours running after a big animal, lets make it a 200 pound one and after doing some field dressing lets  say you have 100 pounds left. If it took you 4 hours to run the distance from where you spotted it, it will take you at least 8 hours to walk back unweighted, probably 12+ hours to walk back if your group is carrying no more than 50 pounds per person. And you are tired and you dont have water.",

The humans can go at the fastest pace that's sustainable all day long.",

And yes we use all our muscles when running. Some just a bit less.\n\nMany muscles are used when running, including: \n\nQuadriceps \n\nLocated in the front of the thigh, these muscles straighten the leg and lift the knee, which helps with acceleration \n\n\nHamstrings \n\nLocated in the back of the thigh, these muscles help slow down the leg and keep the knee bent \n\n\n\nCalves \n\nThese muscles produce the most force during push-off. Weak calves can make a stride look dragging. \n\n\nGlutes \n\nThese muscles help with propulsion and prevent compression where the foot hits the ground \n\n\nHip flexors \n\nLocated in the front of the hip, these muscles flex and extend to move the knee \n\n\nCore \n\nThe main abdominal muscles, the transverse abdominis and obliques, help keep the runner stable \n\n\nOther muscles used when running include upper body muscles. The degree of muscle engagement depends on the terrain and speed of the run. \n\n\nRunning is a whole-body workout that can stimulate muscle growth in the lower body. To improve running form and technique, it's helpful to understand which muscles are involved. Combining running with resistance training can also be effective for muscle growth. ",

Everything from the butt downward is meant to move those legs. \n\nAlso, many of the animals humans evolved to chase down are grazers - highly inefficient eaters.  There's not a lot of nutrition in grass and leaves. Ruminants like goats and cows and gazelles have 4 stomachs, are mostly guts to get every last bit of nutrition from that source.  So the proportion of other body to leg muscles is much less.  Humans, who eat a substantial amount of meat which is mainly protein, require smaller, less complex digestive tracts.\n\nHerbivore animals whose defense is running are usually only capable of running for short distances. The larger ones will then overheat - the amount of sweat that comes off a horse after a race is amazing. They have that fur insulation. plus bigger ones suffer from the square-cube law. (Something twice the size has four times the skin area to shed heat but eight times the volume generating heat). \n\nBut horses and gazelles are much faster. Humans typically did not so much outrun other animals as harry them - keep following at a good pace so they ahd no time to stop and eat or drink. We can run marathons. Horses and cows and goats cannot.  We also developed smarts to plan and excute hunts - for example, tag-team hunting, or positioning others in the team to drive panicking herds where we want them. \n\nThere are plenty of animals we can't outrun, usually because they are either fighters, not runners - for them, we have pointy sticks - or they escape up trees or into burrows.  If a bull decides to turn and put its horns down, we use running or a pointy stick. Plus, we tend to avoid other dangerous animals; we eat herbivores, generally, not other predators. \n\nFun fact - our brains use about a third of all the nutrition we consume.  It was an evolutionary feedback cycle - the more meat we consume - concentrated protein nutrition - the smarter humans were able to become, so the smarts developed fo better hunting made us the big brains we are today. There's a lot more food a lot quicker in killing a big animal than in having to scour for will beans and roots.",

        "comment_body": "That second link is particularly good.\n\nI’ve always been low-key suspicious of some of this based on the “only humans sweat” claim alone. This is obvious “tell me you’ve never been around horses” territory, which in fairness most people these days have not.\n\nBut second, in a battle of just-so stories, on the ancient savannah you’ve got primitive humans with primitive weapons, hunting in groups. You’ve also got multiple species of large cat that have to implement a stalk-and-ambush strategy to survive. After the cats do their thing, you’ve got a varying number of fed cats lying around a carcass, and part of the advantage of the humans’ weapons in the first place is their utility in defending the humans from the cats.\n\nFor the persistence-hunter story to hold up, we have to suppose those bands of humans with weapons would pass up the opportunity to chase a cheetah away from an antelope in a tree, or run a few sated lions off from the remains of a water buffalo, and just keep traveling because spending days running down a fresh giraffe is more dignified or something. I am fairly sure impressing their hypothetical descendants tens of thousands of years in the future would have taken a back seat to feeding their actual offspring today.\n\nI would tentatively buy that humans have certain adaptations that optimize for a nomadic foraging niche, following migratory herds and so forth, with the intelligence to apply varying opportunistic strategies. It’s the need to blow that up into a story of our indomitable apex-predator destiny that seems shaky. It’s like some of us have this weird insecurity about humans being physically mediocre at lots of stuff, as if having terrifyingly big ol’ brains and technology isn’t clearly advantage enough.\n\nFinally, to be blunt, I’ve also always detected the faintest whiff of benevolent racism to this whole “persistence hunter” thing, specifically the way it seems to come up in regards to Kenyans’ performance in Olympic distance running events. When Americans dominate Olympic basketball we don’t feel the need to invent stories about centuries spent tossing fruit into baskets hung from trees or the like.",

Thanks to GPS, we can tag animals and see how they roam about on an average day:\n\n>Elephants will travel close to 500 km looking for water\n\n>A normal day for a Giraffe is 20 km\n    \n>Elk GPS trails show them traveling 400 km to give birth\n\n>So GPS tagging data shows animals normally going 5 to 10 times farther than elite human athletes in an ultramarathon.\n\nSo lets take these one-by-one shall we?\n\n> Elephants will travel close to 500 km looking for water\n\nLink 1 = https://elephantaidinternational.org/elephant-facts/\n\nSo, not a scientific source. Also, where on this page does it say 500km per day?\n\nYes elephants can travel long distances over many days and weeks. That's called migration and it's not what we are discussing. \n\nBad start.\n\n>A normal day for a Giraffe is 20 km\n\nLink 2 = https://www.britannica.com/animal/giraffe\n\nAgain, not a great source.\n\nBut, even worse... where on this page can you find the normal daily range?\n\nThe actual sentence is: \"Bulls eight years and older travel **up to 20 km per day** looking for cows in heat\"\n\nSo the max is 20 km per day, with zero mention of what the traveling speed is, or if rests are included. Again the idea here is that these animals travel too far and too fast to be hunted.\n\nI'm quite confident that a human on foot can travel well beyond 20km in a day. That's certainly not our max. Literal armies of humans on foot carrying weapons and gear can travel 20km in 3-4 hours.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_march\n\nNot looking good.\n\n>Elk GPS trails show them traveling 400 km to give birth\n\nLink 3: https://www.steamboatpilot.com/news/collared-elk-migrates-over-250-miles-through-steamboat-and-over-continental-divide-to-give-birth/\n\nOk, now I know for sure this author isn't serious about using their brain.\n\nJust read the source. \n\n>\"Granted, she did it over the course of several months, but a cow elk in the Bears Ears Elk herd recently migrated from winter range near Maybell to Steamboat Springs and over the Continental Divide to give birth to her calf — a total of at least 255 miles\"\n\nWhat are we even talking about here? I'm confused. Are ultramarathons months long?\n\nLet me double check the claim the author is making.\n\n>So GPS tagging data shows animals normally going 5 to 10 times farther than elite human athletes in an ultramarathon.\n\nOh, yeah. It really is that far off.\n\nThe fact that animals migrate isn't some DEFEAT to the concept of persistence hunting.\n\nIf this one paragraph has this many logical, factual, and citation holes then I have no reason to even consider the rest.",

Incredible really. The upside is that they can produce heaps of power very quickly but the downside of course is that they’re limited to a single breath ‘per step’ and that it takes way more energy. \n\nAnd something else that’s cool is that due to the fact that horses have four legs humans on average have a longer stride than a horse.

With so many trees and bushes, tracking an animal until it was exhausted would require good tracking skills which generally requires intelligence... which early hominids likely lacked.\n\nMore likely, distance movement simply allowed humans to find resources over a wider area, allowing them to survive times of scarcity by finding more abundance further away rather than as a hunting tool.\n\nIt's only later when humans evolved intelligence to use weapons, tools, and traps that the more advanced forms of hunting started. Of note, endurance hunting is not very prevalent in any modern human societies, so there's some question about how prevalent it would have been in the past. But that's extremely difficult to determine without historical or fossil records.\n\nEdit: Here's an article arguing against the endurance hunting theory: [https://undark.org/2019/10/03/persistent-myth-persistence-hunting/](https://undark.org/2019/10/03/persistent-myth-persistence-hunting/)",

Marsupials give birth to very underdeveloped offspring and protect them in a pouch. Humans unlike a lot of other mammals have offspring similarly less developed, in our case to cope with the small pelvis-big head problem. However, many mammals that have nests or burrows have a similar adaptation - as a survival strategy they produce a large litter (cats, dogs, mice, etc.) so they give birth earlier in development and the young can develop hidden in a burrow; as opposed to nomadic animals like cows, horses, elephants, etc. that produce one or two offspring that are born to run, so to speak.",

Faking stuff for good stories to see has been ingrained into nature-making-movies around that time. Did you know lemmings don't actually follow each other off a cliff, but were forced off the cliff to make that shot? I could go on. Here too we have a movie making expedition. \n\n>  guess someone should let the Khoisan tribe know that they’ve all been having a collective hallucination and haven’t eaten food for decades, considering they regularly chase down animals over the course of several hours.\n\nDid you even read your OWN source?  Your evidence isn't what you think it is. \n\n> In July 1985 I worked with Bahbah, Jehjeh, and Hewha at Ngwatle Pan in Botswana. During one ﬁeld trip, ﬁve days of hunting resulted in one gemsbok and two bat-eared foxes killed by **hunting with dogs.**\n\nOops. More on that. How about without dogs ... \n\n> The ﬁrst two persistence hunts were recorded while I accompanied hunters on foot, but many of the data on persistence hunting were obtained on the two ﬁeld expeditions with the **objective of making television documentaries.** On these expeditions the main focus was the persistence hunt almost\nto the exclusion of all other hunting methods. To speed up the process, **the initial scanning for fresh tracks was done with a four-wheel-drive vehicle**, but as soon as the animals were spotted the hunters left the vehicle and started the persistence hunt on foot. For the purpose of ﬁlming the hunters were\n**allowed to reﬁll** their two-liter plastic water bottles **during the hunt** [from the jeep], ... The ﬁlm crew **followed the hunters in the vehicle.**\n\nSo they started hunting in a jeep. They refreshed from the jeep. When you read the field notes you see \"water run\" in the notes. You see that when hunting they'd stop if they found a burrowing animal and dug it up instead for food. \n\nAlso, there's no note about the health of the kudzu ... for all we know they found one that was so old/sick/injured it was about to die anyway.  That's not \"man more efficient than other animals\" that's \"we got there faster than the buzzards when it died anyway\" \n\nThere's plenty of evidence we were scavengers. None to support we'd take down healthy animals on foot through persistent hunting except with jeeps supplying water.",

As sweat glands produce sweat to help cool the body, water is drawn from the body's fluid stores, which also contain dissolved salts. Sodium plays a crucial role in regulating fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions, and it is released with water as the body works to maintain proper electrolyte levels while cooling down.\n\nThe saltiness of sweat is due to the body’s need to excrete excess sodium and maintain the balance of electrolytes. However, the concentration of salt in sweat varies between individuals and is influenced by factors like diet, hydration levels, and acclimatization to heat. When you sweat heavily, more salt may be lost, which is why it's important to replenish both fluids and electrolytes after intense physical activity.",

You annihilate a hole by filling it and the energy creates ripples. A semiconductor crystal can be missing electrons if some of the atoms are replaced with a type that has one fewer (doping) and these \"holes\" behave a lot like positively charged particles.

Everything (for a given value of \"thing\") is made up of these things in various combinations.\n\nBut there are also a bunch of other particles, that are kind of \"mirrors\" to those. Some of their properties are the same, but some are flipped. So, for example, if a proton has a charge of +1, an anti-proton has a charge of -1. But they have the same mass and spin (to get into a bit more detail, there is a thing called \"CPT reversal\", standing for Charge, Parity and Time).\n\nSome fundamental things don't have charge, so for them they are their own anti-particle (like the photon). For others, like the W± particles they are each other's anti-particle.\n\nSo \"anti-matter\" is just \"matter\" that is made up of anti-particles, instead of the regular particles (how we define \"matter\" depends on which area of physics we are in, so let's not worry too much about that).\n\nFor example, a hydrogen atom is made up of an electron and a proton, itself made up of two \"up\" quarks and a \"down\" quark. Anti-hydrogen would be made up of a positron (an anti-electron) and an anti-proton (made up of two \"anti-up\" quarks and an \"anti-down\" quark).\n\nAs far as we know anti-particles behave in the same ways as regular particles other than for this CPT reversal. If you get a particle and an anti-particle together they can annihilate with each other and give off just energy (and similarly, a particle/anti-particle pair can be created given enough energy).\n\nFor some reason in the early universe there was tiny asymmetry between matter and anti-matter (just a little bit more matter). As such while most matter and anti-matter annihilated with each other, a little bit of matter was left over. Hence all the matter in the universe. \"Why\" is one of the current open questions in physics.",

That task can be as simple as looking up the ambient temperature of one \"thing's\" area. It could also be a task to tell another \"thing\" to turn on... like a light switch.\n\nWhen you have a lot of different things that can perform different tasks, measure various values, etc, you now have a system where all these different things can perform simple or complicated tasks. Your system can be as small as 1 thing or as large as millions of things.\n\nYou typically get to decide who and what can see/interact with all your devices. Lastly, wifi isn't the only way they connect to the internet. Wifi also isn't the only way they can be remotely accessed/interacted with. There's wifi/RJ45 cable (which is how they all connect to the cloud/interenet), bluetooth, Zwave, Zigbee, Matter, Thread, Infrared, and a bunch of other wireless technologies that allow one thing to see another thing remotely.\n\nSo, your devices can connect to each other without the \"internet\" and don't need the internet to work together, but your system brain (the thing that interprets the devices' info and interactions) is usually connected to the internet so that you can remotely control them when you're out of range of the other wireless protocols.\n\nThink of actual internet as being the longest range remote protocol (miles upon miles - literally other side of the world).\n\nBluetooth, Zwave, Zigbee, Matter, Thread, etc are all remote radios that only work within a close proximity (like 1 to a few hundred meters depending on the protocol).",

For example, Illinois is a reliably democratic state in presidential elections. For presidential candidates, its less useful to campaign in these states because if the state reliably votes for your party, you don't need to use your resources to try and garner votes in that state, and if they reliably vote for the other party, you're unlikely to change enough voters minds to actually win that state. Again, it doesn't matter if you get millions of votes in a state if you don't get the majority of the votes in that state.\n\nGoing into a presidential election, you can effectively \"map out\" how many electoral votes candidates will receive from these \"safe\" states, however neither major party has enough \"safe\" electoral votes to win a presidential election, so they need to win some of the swing states to win the presidential election.\n\nSwing states are states that don't reliably vote for one part or another, sometimes they go one way, sometimes they go another. These states are super important to presidential candidates, and are where they spend a large portion of their campaign time and money.

It was then won by Joe Biden in 2020 by a similar margin, a little over 20,000 votes.  It's likely to be a close call this year as well.\n\nThis means that candidates campaigning for President have a lot to gain from focusing their campaign efforts and funding in Wisconsin and other \"swing states,\" to win those electoral points, compared to \"safe states\" where it's unlikely that a candidate won't win a majority.  It's why in the current election, both candidates have spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and a few others, particularly over the last few weeks of the campaign.",

These clouds are created when the air is unstable : warm air rising rapidly etc. They created very strong updrafts and down drafts. The rain droplets that go up and down hit each other and create static.\n\n  The cumulonimbus are quite larger during summer in humid, warm days than cold and dry winter days. During summer they often reach 40 000 feet, while they rarely top 25 000 feet during cold winter.\n\nThe difference in size means that less static is created, thus less lighting!\n\nOn another topic, flying at high speed through snow or ice crystals created a lot of static on an aircraft windshield, and you can often see St-Elmo's fire! It's basically small lightning on the windshield. It looks pretty neat",

This value is often over 1000 J/kg in the summer across the United States (and can push over 5000).\n\nCold air, particularly cold enough for snow, has extremely small CAPE values. In Wyoming where it is currently snowing, the measured  CAPE value is 4 J/kg. That means the energy available for storms is about 250 times lower than a typical summer day.",

One such thing is the sample size: If I ask 40 people the same 5 questions and 39 of them give the same exact answers that's 97.5% of people answering the same way. However, let's say it is revealed that I asked 40 people who all happened to be white men on a college campus and got that result: that is very, very different than if I asked 40 people from 40 different states of varying racial or ethnic backgrounds that same question/questions. And the bigger the number of people I ask the more accurate the poll is. 40 people, as a sample size for a country with a population of 300 million people, is not very big. But if I ask 4,000 people that's a much broader spread of potential variations in background, education, life experiences... in short the sample size has a huge impact on how accurate the results of the poll are.\n\nAnother thing that can determine the quality of the poll is the way that the question is worded. Poorly worded, confusing, or intentionally misleading questions can get people to provide information that is wildly inaccurate. Let's say I ask \"Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?\" and you say 'No' I could interpret that to mean that you are voting for Kamala Harris... except that you might be voting for Jill Stein, RFK jr., or not intending to vote at all! And those interpretations all provide very different context for what the poll means. So the questions also have to calibrate for incomplete or misleading responses.",

Places have to try really really hard to eliminate biases. It’s actually easier to lean one way or the other. There are dozens of ways to lie via real statistics. For example, take a look at Mississippi’s wages. If you look at “average” or “mean” wage, it’s not bad; $52k in 2021. But if you look at ‘median’ wage, or what the average worker makes, it’s $35k. That’s due to a few rich people making a lot of money, skewing the average.

When conducting an opinion poll, what you need to do is take a sample of people and ask them. \n\nBut how do you know your sample is representative? Well, there are some things you need to do:\n\n* Examine the demographics of your poll (gender, race, income, religion, sexual identity, profession) and compare that to the average in society as a whole. If 90% of your sample is university-educated white public sector women from suburban D.C., you're going to get a voting response that's very different to the actual national result. \n\n* Weighting your results based on each demographics' propensity to vote. There are simply some types of people who are more likely to vote than others. If you have a lot of 'low voting' demographics in your poll, you might get a heavily distorted result - yes they all SAY they're going to vote for Candidate X, but they won't actually do so. \n\n* Have a sample size large enough for each demographic to be at least close to representative. If you have only 5 black people in your poll, and all 5 just happen to support Candidate Y, you're going to get a false \"100% of black people support Y\" outcome. \n\n* Have no obvious biases, or at least not letting your biases get in the way of reporting the results. If you really *really* favour Candidate Y over X, maybe you might subtly weight the results so it looks like Y is doing better (even subconsciously). \n\nSo a poll's \"quality\" generally depends on how well they do the above things. Is their sample representative and weighted appropriately? Do they have a history of favouring one side over the other? Is their track record from past elections pretty solid?\n\nOf course, with the increasingly partisan nature of politics - especially online - the question of which poll is 'best' often boils down to \"Which poll is telling me what I want to hear?\", which is obviously a different issue entirely.",

In other words, the people you are polling have to accurately represent the larger group of people whose opinion you seek. So, for example, if you wanted to know how pipefitters in Chicago felt about a certain issue, it would not make sense to poll nurses in Cincinnati.\n\nNow, that example is pretty obvious. But in real life it is not always so easy. If you are trying to get poll results for a whole state, you need to find a sample group that accurately reflects that state. And that can be tricky. Demographics are constantly changing, so what was true for one election might not be true for the same place four years later.\n\nMost Americans have seen the famous photo from the 1948 election of President Harry S. Truman holding up a newspaper bearing the headline \"DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN,\" when he had done no such thing. But polls had shown him well ahead of Truman. So what happened? Simple. They didn't have an accurate sample set. Why? Because the polls were mostly conducted by telephone, and in 1948 telephones were far from ubiquitous. They were much more common in wealthy households. So, while Dewey might have won the demographic of people with home phones, that did not translate into an overall majority and he lost the election.\n\nThis year there has been a lot of talk about how younger people are extremely difficult to reach by phone, and how polling has tried to adapt. It will be interesting to see how closely the final election results tomorrow track with polls heading into the election.\n\nYou may have seen a recent poll from the *Des Moines Register* that placed Harris slightly ahead of Trump in Iowa, which is rather dramatically contrary to expectations. One of the reasons this poll has gotten so much attention is that their pollster, Ann Selzer, has an excellent reputation for picking good sample sets and getting accurate results.",

        "comment_body": "Here are a few examples of the pitfalls of polling:\n\nHistorically in the 20th century polling was done by calling a bunch of people at random and getting their answers. You couldn’t block numbers on landlines back in the day, nor would you know who was calling you until you picked up so it was normal to pick up any phone call and then the pollster would ask their questions. With cell phones, you can screen calls and block numbers. The result was that pollsters started getting more answers from older people who still used landlines, and they undersampled the young who preferred cellphones. That led to less accurate polls as the young and the old have different voting profiles.\n\nAnother problem is something called “the Bradley Effect.” This refers to when Tom Bradley was running for mayor of Los Angeles. He was black and eventually became Los Angeles’s first black mayor. But when they polled before the election, the pollsters found he did significantly more favorably in the polls than he did on election day. The reason was that some people didn’t want to say they weren’t voting for him because they thought they’d sound racist. This effect has subsequently been seen in other elections with other minorities and women. \n\nThen there’s deceptive polling where the poll is there to create an impression not find a genuine result. So like a pollster could ask a confusing or ambiguous or deceptive question to get a result they want. \n\nAnd finally, it’s important to take into account the biases of the researchers. Rasmussen Reports is a polling company that has been accused of being biased in favor of the Republican Party. Its findings consistently show poll results more favorable towards Republican candidates than other polls do. In comparing their poll findings with the actual election results, it has been shown they have a very poor track record of correctly prediction outcomes. They’re one of the worst. Now ostensibly polling companies want to be the most accurate, not least accurate, so a reliable and transparent company will be upset at the inaccuracies of their polls and adjust their methodology to get more accurate results. But when companies *don’t* do that and consistent show bad results time and again, that means they’re either incompetent or they *want* to be inaccurate for their own reasons. Like Rasmussen has become a favorite of republicans because they show them being more successful. That’s going to get the company more business from republicans.  Thus Rasmussen’s repeated inaccurate findings have resulted in aggregator sites like 538 no longer including their findings in their data. ",

        "comment_body": "So the key thing is, no poll is going to ask literally EVERYONE. Most polls you see are a couple hundred to a couple thousand people.\n\nThey try to estimate what the entirety of the population based on this sample of people that they ask.\n\nThere’s a couple things that can go wrong. Let’s assume we’re polling to find out if people if they prefer AC/DC or Taylor Swift’s music across all of the United States:\n\n- Too small of a sample size. In this example, you ask 2 people. They both say they prefer AC/DC, so your poll suggests that 100% of the population prefers AC/DC. \nThis…definitely isn’t true. When you have too small of a sample, random chance starts to be a major factor and your results will be inaccurate. \n\nThere’s ways to really quantify this (you’ll hear the term “margin of error”, this is basically a “we’re 95% certain that the actual result is between these two values, but where it is depends of some amount of randomness, ie you shouldn’t be shocked if you flip a coin 10 times and get 4 heads and 6 tails even though the chance is 50-50), but quantifying it is complicated\n\n- Another source of error is not picking a representative sample. Let’s say you polled exclusively teenage girls. Now, even if you got a large sample size, this probably isn’t going to give you accurate results. It’s likely you’ll vastly overestimate Taylor Swift’s relative popularity because she’s certainly more popular among this group. Likewise if you polled exclusively men in their 50s-60s. It’ll probably give you skewed results. Now, most sampling errors are less extreme than this. They try to get a sample of people that mixes up different demographics, but doing this well is very very hard and a huge source of error\n\n- The extrapolation step. This is doing the math after getting your sample and trying to see what it says about everyone. Let’s say you guess that age and gender are the main factors that come into play. So you break your sample into 4 groups, young women, young men, old women, and old men. In your poll, you find what portion prefers each in these groups, then look at what portion of the overall US population fits in each of these groups, and multiply each by the portion you found prefers each to estimate the overall result.\n\nNow…realistically, there’s probably more nuance to estimating this than age and gender. Maybe whether you’re poor or rich plays into it. Maybe people of different cultural backgrounds differ a lot on this. Maybe “Age” needs to be dove into more because maybe 40-60 year olds tend to feel very differently on this than 61+ year olds. The point is, in this sample, we missed some pretty important variables, so our 4 categories were too simplistic and could make our end result wrong by a LOT\n\n\nSo…the first point about sample size is pretty straightforward, a poll will tell you how many people they polled, and more is better. But usually when we’re talking about quality pollsters, we’re talking about the other 2 points. Some pollsters do a better job getting a representative sample and some do a better job of finding the categories to break people into that represent the whole. \n\nThe “margin of error” largely deals with the first point about sample size, but pollsters can be wrong by much more if they do a bad job on the latter 2 points. Notably in the 2016 presidential election, Trump was thought to have been underestinated largely because of point 3 here, they didn’t all account of education of the voter, and it turned out that this was a variable that played a pretty big role",

Margin of error gives a range for expected results _if the sample size is truly representative of the whole_.\n\nConsider a company with 1,000 employees. If you randomly select 100 of them and ask, \"Are you happy with the current Work from Home policy?\" the results are likely to reflect the views of the whole company quite accurately. You can calculate a margin of error (say, 5.9%) for this survey, which accounts for the possibility that your random sample might not perfectly represent everyone. As you increase the sample size, the margin of error will decrease.\n\nHowever, if you ask a question like, \"Will you be in the office on Tuesday?\" the poll becomes less reliable, despite having the same margin of error. This is because you've introduced a form of systematic error. While most people who answer \"yes\" probably mean it at the time, their plans may change, making the results less predictable and less reliable, even though the calculated margin of error stays the same.\n\nCertainly there are complicated techniques where pollsters can figure subgroup weighting into their stated margin of error, but there are still a lot of possible \"errors\" that are simply not considered and I think it's generally misleading to even publish the MoE in the news because it's not really what people think it is.\n\nEdit: And I think the real danger there is that if the polls have consistently shown that a candidate will get 47% +/- 3% it's _entirely_ possible that they can get 42% without any of the polls being wrong or there being any election fraud.

Such taxes *do not exist.* No sovereign nation would tolerate such an assault, because it would be blatant theft.\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. This means, any time anyone buys goods from some other country and imports them into the US, the *buyer* pays any tariffs on those goods. But the only people who can *import* things into the US...are people in the US. As a result, tariffs necessarily raise the price of goods that come from those imports, because they're taxed while local goods aren't. This means that tariffs make the overall economy less efficient than it could possibly be, but they can still have overall positive effects if used carefully.\n\nTariffs serve two main functions. The first is to protect domestic production against foreign manipulation. Let's say the Allied Federation of Fedoria and Yugopotamia are two countries, and Yugopotamia wants to capture a bunch of the AFF market for cars. So Yugopotamia gives a bunch of government subsidies to its domestic manufacturing, making it dirt-cheap to build cars. This is economically inefficient in the short term, but it can allow Yugopotamia to drive AFF auto makers out of business, thus giving Yugopotamia the dominant market share. To combat this trade manipulation, the AFF can impose a tariff on Yugopotamian cars. This will eliminate the price manipulation, and allow domestic manufacturing (which is cheaper long-term and has other benefits if it remains healthy) to remain competitive.\n\nThe second use of tariffs is as a tool of diplomatic or political leverage. If country A makes a LOT of money selling (say) crude oil to country B, but country B is much more influential and powerful, then B could pressure A to change policies or alter its goals by threatening or implementing tariffs on crude oil from A. This is a softer form of \"sanctions\" than outright blocking trade, but can still be effective. Of course, if two similarly powerful nations go head to head, you get a trade war, which is not generally good for either side, but that's a different subject.\n\nBut again, I want to stress: tariffs are NEVER paid by the country where the goods came from. They are, 100% always, paid by the people *buying* the goods for import, meaning, citizens of the country imposing the tariff. Tariffs almost always result in higher prices, because the person/company paying the tax has to make that money back somewhere else. Net result, tariffs are a sales tax on imported goods, which becomes a functional sales tax on the things regular folks actually buy.",

More likely they will just increase the price by $5. While they have to pay the tariff, if they just increase the price by an additional $5, now technically the customer is paying the tariff.

Or maybe they make it $14 and try to sell more via marketing \"Our robot is better than theirs\"\n\nCompetition is good as it keeps people from price gouging, but the idea is that people in China are oppressed and paid too little, which gives their goods an unfair advantage, which just perpetuates the problem further.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, tariffs might not have the desired effect. Instead of encouraging fair pricing and good competition, it might just drive all prices up. If the US and South American companies are greedy, then they might see it as \"well if China now has to charge $15, we can get away with charging $20 if we can keep people buying ours\" This leads to propaganda against China, or other shady tactics.\n\nAt the end of the day, the problem is just greed, plain and simple. People in power that make money use their power to squeeze every cent out of the people responsible for the money they make.",

        "comment_body": "Assuming that no retaliation happens (we'll come back to that later):\n\n> If country A imposed a tariff on country B, how would that affect the price of imports and exports between the two?\n\nProducts coming from Country B into Country A would be more expensive. There would be no impact on products from Country A going into Country B (but there's a *but* there).\n\n> I could also use some help understanding what a tariff is in the first place. Is it like an extra fee a company needs to pay in order to ship something internationally?\n\nAre you familiar with sales tax? That's basically what a tariff is, except that it's applied at the wholesale level instead of the retail level. To use a concrete example:\n\nLet's say I work for a car manufacturer... Bored Motor Company. I need to buy steel for my cars. I can buy steel from a domestic producer, who is selling it at $950/ton. Or I can buy steel from a Chinese producer and pay $500/ton. Assuming that the steel from China meets my quality needs, I'm probably going to buy from China. It'll let me lower the cost of production, which gives me more leeway to lower the price on my vehicles while still making a profit. And since I want to sell more than my competitors, lowering the price is something I would like to do.\n\nNow, we elect someone... let's call him Dump... who wants to put a tariff of 20% on everything coming into the country. When Bored goes to buy that steel from China, Dump's tariffs add 20% to the purchase cost. So instead of buying the Chinese steel at $500/ton, I have to pay $600/ton, with the extra $100/ton being money I just pay to the US government for the privilege of buying something from a foreign country. Ultimately, to maintain my profit margins I have the raise the price of my vehicles.\n\nAnd yes, it is the domestic company that pays the tariff, not the foreign entity I purchase from. Not that it would make a difference in the overall price - if the foreign company paid it, they would just mark up the price accordingly, and I would still pay the tariff-adjusted price.\n\n> And what's the goal with applying a tariff?\n\nUsually, the goal of a tariff is to protect your domestic industry. If American steel can't be made as cheaply as Chinese steel, then we just artificially inflate the price of Chinese steel until the two are equal. \n\nThere are some limited cases where tariffs make sense. Mostly it's to help prop up a strategically important segment of industry, like the steel I used in my example. If you have a large military-industrial complex, then you desperately want at least some sources of steel that are under your control. So if prices are close to parity, a tariff is a low-impact strategy that I can use to keep domestic producers competitive, which keeps them alive and producing in case our foreign supplies ever get interrupted.\n\nYou might also use a tariff to discourage trade between nations without going to full-on sanctions, either because you don't want to halt trade or because you can't get Congress to pass those sanctions.\n\nBut for the most part, tariffs just don't work in the global economy. Notice how even with a 20% tariff, it was still cheaper for me to buy Chinese steel than American steel. And if there's a tariff in place, that increase in price will 100% be passed on to the final consumer (we know this, because that's exactly what has happened in every tariff situation).\n\nAnd finally, there's a real risk with tariffs. If you slap a tariff on products from one country, they're highly likely to slap one on products from your country. And American goods are almost always on the pricier end of the spectrum, so it doesn't take much to knock them out of price contention. Again, this isn't conjecture - this is exactly what happened in the tariffs that Trump enacted in his first term. We put tariffs on a boatload of Chinese goods, so they put tariffs on our soybeans. Virtually overnight, the largest market for our domestic soybean farmers (China) evaporated, with most Chinese companies choosing to purchase from Brazil and other countries over American growers because they were no longer price-competitive.",

        "comment_body": "A tariff is a tax applied on goods imported from a specific country. So if a 10% tariff is put on steel imported from China, then the company buying that steel (let’s assume it’s a US company and the US government has imposed the tariff) has to pay 10% of the value of what they’ve imported to the US Government. Because these businesses incur additional costs, this is likely to be reflected in higher prices for consumers of the final product \n\nThe main reason why tariffs are used are to ‘protect’ domestic consumers from international competition (by raising the cost for imports). \n\nMany countries conclude trade agreements to reduce or eliminate tariffs on each other’s goods and services, and harmonise product standards. The EU for example has an external tariff scheme for its member states which sets the same tariff rates for goods and services entering any country in the EU from outside the Union, whilst trade between countries within the EU is tariff free.",

If people won't pay 10% more for those apples they won't be imported, but then demand for other apples will go up and their cost will rise because of the limited supply and lack of competition.

Corn produced abroad we will put a 10% tariff on, now the company who is making and shipping that corn to the US isn’t just going to take a hit to their already thin margins they will increase the price for the consumer by 10%. this will give local producers an additional advantage to sell their own corn. The problem is other countries will respond with their own tariffs making your corn unable to sell abroad and disincentives trade not just for corn but other products as well. Local producers will also seek to regain those profits locally and may raise prices to say 8% higher still competitive but worse for the end consumer.\n\nNow let’s take something more complex like electronics, if you setup a tariff on all imported goods it includes things that you don’t produce locally like the majority of electronics this just raises the prices of everything across the board for consumers, even simpler things like some fruits or coffee beans that we don’t produce locally (at scale) because our climate doesn’t allow it. You effectively just raised all those prices to the end consumer.\n\nIn short a tariff is a tax to import a good into a country said tax is always passed to the end consumer and responded to by other countries in kind and will always be worse for the end consumer.

These could be specific products from Country B, *all* products from Country B, or even *all* products from *every* country that isn't Country A.\n\nThe tax is paid by the company or person in Country A that wants to bring the products across the border into Country A.  So a tariff is a tax that Country A imposes on its own people and companies.  In particular, the government of Country B doesn't pay the tariff.\n\nAs a practical example, let's say that Country A imposes a 10% tariff on home furnishings imported from Country B; let's also say that I'm a buyer for a chain of home decorating stores.  I buy folding chairs by the boatload.  Before the tariff, I got my chairs for $10 each from a manufacturer in Country B.  The company sold those chairs for $20 each -- about $1 in profit per chair, and the other $9 helped the store's other costs, everything from interest payments on the money borrowed to buy the chairs to the cost to insure the chair inventory and from the cost of shipping the chairs to the salaries of the employees that sell them.\n\nBut now there's a 10% tariff on home furnishings imported from Country B. So my $10 chairs cost another $1 per chair (paid to the government of Country A) before they can be unloaded from the boat and shipped to stores.  Now I have a problem -- I can't price these chairs at $20.  If I do, the company doesn't make any profit on them, and I lose my job.  The company guideline is a retail price of 2x the cost of goods with a 5% profit margin.  So I now have to price the folding chairs at $22.  The company makes $1.10 per chair in profit, and $9.90 to cover other costs.\n\nSo tariffs increase the cost that consumers pay for products.\n\nThe *goal* of a tariff is to make the imported product so expensive that consumers will buy products from other sources -- for example, products that are produced in Country A are not subject to tariffs because they aren't imported.  So *if* a manufacturer in Country A could make equivalent chairs for *less* than $11 per chair, I would be doing better to buy the domestically-produced chairs instead.  \n\nHowever, if the domestic manufacturer of folding chairs charges $15 per chair, then a 10% tariff won't convince me to switch suppliers -- all it does is raise the cost of the chairs to consumers. Even with the tariff it is still cheaper to get the chairs from the manufacturer in Country B.  In this specific example, a bigger tariff (50% or more) would be needed to make me switch suppliers -- but it would also mean that the chairs that used to cost $20 each in the store now cost $30 each.\n\nFinally, Country B likes that its factories manufacture chairs to sell to stores Country A.  It keeps their factories running, their citizens employed, and helps grow the economy of Country B.  So if Country A uses a tariff to get its people not to buy chairs made in those factories, then that hurts the economy of Country B. Country B may impose its own tariff on certain products it imports from Country A, with the idea being that they could then negotiate and drop all of the tariffs.",

        "comment_body": "Nice start. The only thing I think you're missing is a bit of the profit motives of domestic producers. \n\nTariffs are an \"import substitution\" strategy. \n\n1. A tax is applied to the imported good to raise its price.\n2. The idea is to make the combined price of the cheaper imported good + taxes paid match (or exceed) the price of the domestic good. \n3. In theory, if the domestic good is lower in price, consumers switch to the domestic good. \n\nFor example, let's say imported potatoes are $100/bushel while domestic potatoes are $125. Applying a 25% tariff gets you to parity: \n\n$100 + (25% x $100) = $125 Imported Potato, total cost = $125 domestic potato\n\nNow the problem is that if you get to parity domestic goods = imported goods, you don't spur production in the country.  So sometimes what's done is you try to raise the tariff so the imported goods are more expensive than the domestic products. Or, instead a 25% tariff, we apply a 75% tariff - or \n\n$100 + (75% x $100) = $175 Imported Potato > $125 domestic potato\n\nBut herein lies the problem, if the government decides to create a profit opportunity due to taxation, the domestic players will take advantage of that for as long as humanly possible.\n\nFor example, if overnight all imported potatoes become $175, without a doubt, the next day all imported potatoes will be around $175. Over time the theory is that domestic producers will ramp up production and potato prices come down.\n\nHowever that immediate bump is one reason why people talk about tariffs are being an inherently inflationary strategy. \n\nFWIW, there are also issues around capacity as well. In many countries the price is where it is because quantity demanded = quantity supplied.  Or, all the tariff does is increase taxes for citizens of your country because there are no domestic units to purchase.",

When you bend charged particles in a circular path, you are slowing the particle along the tangent direction. This causes x-rays to be emitted. \n\nSo there is a LOT of energy being thrown at the walls without any plasma directly touching them.\n\nThere are also areas where the plasma effectively touches some areas, known as diverters. These are used to draw off waste products. Understandably, they get ferociously hot and need to be cooled. That heat can contribute to the heat energy passed to the turbines.",

The neutrons have the majority of the energy, 14.06 Mev out of -17MeV per fusion reaction. The neutron then deposits energy on the walls and the structural materials, generate gammas and all that, and all that energy gets \"extracted\" by a coolant and that coolant generates usually steam to turn a turbine. There are more unique designs that does direct electron capture but for tokamaks that'll probably be the way to generate electricity usually.  Hope it helps!\n\nTLDR; fusion shoots fast and energetic neutrons, they hit other things, things get hot, hot gets cooled by coolant, that coolant gets hot, that hot coolant makes steam that turns turbine to make electricity (big caveat - depends on the design)",

A lot of reasons play into this: Water expands into steam when heated, generating pressure. This provides an easy way to convert thermal energy into kinetic energy via using the steam pressure, exploiting the physical properties of water. Water is also non-reactive and abundant, so as long as you take measures against corrosion for your machinery, you can just vent that shit right into the air and there's no environmental repercussions (for the steam, at least. Coal-driven plants and the like obviously have their own emission issues, but those aren't due to the steam). Water is also incredibly cheap - where you have people, you tend to also have water, and water is kind of common, so there's never going to be supply issues.\n\nA significant number of \"modern\" power systems are ultimately, just ways to generate heat to boil water for... a steam turbine.\n\nNuclear reactors? Uses heat from the reaction to boil water.\n\nCoal power plant? Burns coal to boil water.\n\nNatural gas? Burns natural gas to boil water.\n\nTokamak? Use the self-sustaining plasma from the reaction as a heat source to... you guessed it, boil water.\n\nThere are obviously plenty of power generation methods out there that DON'T use steam turbines, but they haven't replaced steam turbines yet as the main method of industrial-scale power generation for two main reasons: Scalability, and the ability to modulate power output based on grid demand.\n\nOther power generation methods either can't, or can't cost-effectively, scale their power output, and tends to be affected by external conditions that make it unsuited for providing stable power. Solar generates power from the sun, but there's only so much one panel can generate. You'd need a huge amount of panels to generate enough power to replace say, a coal or nuclear plant, and even if you did - if the sun isn't available, your power goes down. This is an issue if your say, trying to run a city, and the sun goes down, because it's night, and people start turning on lights and heaters, increasing demand when your generation is reduced. Same goes for wind - if it's not windy, your power generation goes down, so it's not consistent. Other methods like Radiothermal generation have consistent outputs, but are far less efficient than traditional nuclear reactors and have radiological concerns, and also issues with max output.\n\nTo contrast, a steam-turbine power plant's power output is modulated simply by changing the rate your inputting energy. Coal power plant? burn more or less coal as needed. Nuclear plant? raise or lower the reaction rate. This lets steam-turbine plants output consistent power that can meet demands based on grid requirements. It's also why moving away from fossil fuels has been so hard - other than nuclear, nothing can really match the consistency and output of a fossil-fuel plant.",

But, Heat doesn't just flow like oil. You have to pump water INTO the ground, then get it back out once it's heated up. The earth's crust is a great insulator. Which means that the cold water will actually quickly cool any path way you pump it through. So you need a very long path, or a Lot of paths, that you can pump high volumes of water through. One way to get those paths is fracking. Which is not a hit among people looking for alternative power. \n\nSo far we have only done this in areas that are naturally well suited, which are quite limited. \nIdeally you find a super hot underground spring and can just extract  the steam, and perhaps add a bit more ground water supply a couple km away to make up for it.",

The surrounding rock is still hot, so more heat will indeed flow to the borehole, but that doesn't happen instantly. If you draw too much energy from a borehole it *will* cool down, and you're left having to drill a new borehole into rock which is still hot.\n\nGeothermal energy is a great option for locations with the right geology, but a startup claiming that \"virtually any\" power plant can be converted to geothermal using Magical Innovative Technology sounds like a scam to me.",

It'll cut into you with less direct force.\n\nBut all else is not equal. The more dull knife requires more force to cut whatever you actually intend to cut. Using more force requires engaging larger muscles that have less fine motor control. Using more force requires you to have less control over the knife.\n\nIt's that expected lack of control that makes dull knives more dangerous. If you're cutting something very soft, like, say, tofu, then you could practically use a butter knife with little force, so there's no real concern, but for most kitchen work, you want a sharper knife.

But, if wielded carefully, they tend to cut how and where you want, with less injury. Dull knives force people to use more force, which lowers their precision. More likely to slip and, if you're applying a lot of force when it slips, the increase in power behind the slip will more than compensate for dullness. Secondly, in the event of getting cut, a sharp blade will make a finer cut that goes deeper, so it may bleed more, but it usually is easy to bandage and heals quickly. A dull blade will tear at the flesh more than slice it, leaving larger openings and more damaged flesh, increasing risk of infection and scarring. So, overall, a sharp knife can cut you more easily, but probably won't. \n\nIf you see more injuries happening with sharp knives, if may be people that are used to dull knives applying way too much force. I used to have a kitchen knife that was pretty bad; to get through, say, a raw chicken breast, I had to really hack and saw at it. Then I moved to a house with some pretty good knives, and cut myself a few times (never seriously, just nicks) because I'd learned very careless habits.

When I said dull it down, that could be through regular use or outright dulling the edge on purpose (such as trying to cut a steel pipe with it).\n\nAs others have described, when dull blades cut, more pressure is required. More force means less control, which can lead to accidents.",

So if you drink coffee every morning for 10 years because you want to wake up quickly, you might become used to the effects of coffee, not because it no longer has physiological effect, but because you no longer remember the feeling of waking up on your own. So, if you then run out of coffee for two weeks, suddenly waking up feels *horrible*...not necessarily because of any physical addiction or tolerance (though that can happen with caffeine), but because now, waking up unaltered feels wrong and bad.\n\nPsychological tolerance develops more slowly than physiological tolerance. The two have no direct relation: you can have either one, both, or neither. But, in general, physiological tolerance to recreational drugs (as opposed to valid prescriptions) also induces some degree of psychological tolerance. Psychological tolerance can be very difficult to break, because it depends on the person *wanting* to change, and being willing to endure something they find unpleasant.",

For example, the first time I moved to a very big city (I grew up in a smaller city, but still a city), I became acquainted with the awful, *awful* smell of summertime garbage day for the particular area I lived in. The stench was *really* obvious to me, as someone who hadn't grown up there. For someone who had lived their whole lives in that area, or who had grown up in a similar mega-city, it was nothing; they'd been used to a smell like that for decades.\n\nIt would take a truly monumental stench for that tolerance to go away. And, likewise, it would take living months or years in a place with very clean air and no smelly trash days in order to get used to the absence of such a smell, so that when you returned to the city, it would be noticeable again. No real \"learning\" happens here; it's just that your brain tunes out the experience as extraneous noise. Our brains are pretty good at picking up on significant *changes,* but when nothing changes for a long time, it becomes background.\n\nBut you aren't wrong to make a link to learning, just to be clear. When I studied music in primary and secondary school, I had to learn breathing techniques, especially because I have asthma. Such conscious attention to my breathing changed how I breathe, and meant I rarely needed an inhaler in high school unless I was specifically sick or dealing with allergies. Those skills have faded now, from lack of practice, but it would be easier to pick them back up than it was to learn them in the first place.",

        "comment_body": "Won’t get into why in this comment (feel free to ask though) but the basic rules of a bicycle/motorcycle are as follows.\n\n1. If you begin a turn the handlebars to the left, this causes you to lean right.\n\n2. As the bike leans left, the handlebars want to turn left.\n\nBoth rules apply with left and right switched too.\n\nThese are important in bike design. They are the two fundamental rules that keep bikes stable and upright. Say you start accidentally leaning left, even without your hands at the handlebars rule 2 says the bike starts to turn left and because of that rule 1 says the bike starts to lean to the right, bringing you back upright. \n\nA deathwobble happens when these factors however overcorrect.\n\nIn nearly all cases the wobble starts with the front wheel being lifted off the ground and placed back down, be it from a wheelie or just a bump. But it’s not placed back straight, it’s placed to a side, say to the left. From there we get the following.\n\n\n1. Handlebars angle left. Due to rule 1, the bike starts leaning to the right, and quickly too, since you didn’t slowly turn into this your wheel landed that way.\n\n2. The lean causes rule 2 to kick in, bike handlebars turn right. \n\n3. Bike starts leaning more to the left because of rule 1. Now we want a little bit of this because it will bring the bike back upright, but due to the speed at which this is all occurring at the bike overshoots due to the momentum of the turning wheel and starts leaning right.\n\nThen this all repeats, on the other side.\n\nThe bike is tuned to have rules 1 and 2 apply in the proper way when the wheels naturally turn and lean such that it can bring the bike upright and stable. However the landing of the wheel wrong causes it to overcorrect, this system is designed to handle gradual turns not a sudden left swerve due to the wheel landing wrong. This, and the tuning of these two factors depends on a variable, your center of mass, which is different for every rider and even different body position on the bike, which also causes over correction.\n\n\nYou shouldn’t fight the wobble. Half the wobble is trying to save you here, the other half is trying to kill you, fighting it may cause you to fight the part that’s trying to save you. The wobble is fed by speed though, and you should gently try to slow down.",

This leads to something called \"tank slappers\" where your handlebars are wobbling back and forth so fast and violently that the handles literally bang off the gas tank until you slow down or fall over.\n\nA smart rider will let go of the handlebars (you can't really hang on without risking your wrists) when that happens and let the bike slow down.  The speed control for a motorcycle is on the right wrist, so when you let go, the bike starts to lose speed automatically.  At that point, it's a matter of balancing as the front of the bike vibrates like HELL and PRAY that you don't fall down at whatever ridiculous speed you were at when the slappers started.\n\nI have a friend who got \"tank slappers\"/death wobbles at 125 miles per hour and survived with his heart in his throat.  He came home needing to tell someone so he called me.  I was the guy who TAUGHT HIM HOW TO RIDE, so I told him if he EVER did that again, I would personally come and take his bike away.\n\nThey are dangerous and usually caused by extreme speed and irregular maintenance.",

Loosen your grip on the handlebars but keep the grip. Lean forward or  lean on the tank to get more weight on the front. \n\nThe natural physics of the bike wants to go straight. Slowing, gentle rear brake, and weight on the front wheel all helps make the correction the bike wants to make to stabilize. \n\nComments about wheelies only work by fully resetting the front traction. But only if landing the front wheel straight. Wheelies can actually be a cause of the death wobble if you don't land straight.  Most riders don't do wheelies, so that's not going to be a good option for most. \n\nSlow down by rolling off the throttle.  Gentle rear brake.

But if he just relaxed and stopped fighting it, the internal controls of the machine would have corrected it. But he panicked and made the problem worse.\n\n\nIt's kinda like that. The forces of the road on the bike's front tire are working to straighten it after a bump. But they are overcorrecting each time and swinging the tire left and right. Trying to straighten it yourself would be adding another PI-type controller to the system and make it worse.\n\n\nBut get as much weight off of the front wheel as possible and slow down and its own forces will stabilize it on its own after a bit.

The enclosure might resonate at certain frequencies that could help or hinder the sound quality  electronic components have tolerances, and cheaper ones will do the job at the expense of responsiveness at certqin frequencies.\n\nLike a tin can phone, where a nylon string drawn tight and a good aluminum can might transmit sound better than a plastic can with a yarn string.\n\nGood materials and engineering cost a lot, and this translates into a more expensive product. Most of that goes into brand name recognition of course.\n\nBut of coirse most people haven't had a chance to compare a live concert vs a recorded one (just to pish a point) also people have diffetent responsiveness to sound due to age  experience  environment.",

Generally cheaper units have less accurate sound profiles or overly exaggerate certain aspects (boosting bass is super common) and downplay other aspects (you will hear audiophiles complain about 'muddy mids' a lot).\n\nShitty speakers/headphones will crush the sound and distort. Better tuned drivers will return more accurate and more full sound. Though units have different use cases, for example, studio headsets aim for a more neutral flat profiles because they're made for production purposes, not necessarily for recreational listening. I got a pair once that I found I didn't like the cold mechanical profile to.\n\nThere are definitely considerations, like what you like to listen to, what you're using them for, and then some preference things (many audiophiles will laude open-back cans for example for their grander airier sound profile, but they come with the tradeoff of significant bleed, i.e. people around you will hear it too), but in general, it's mostly just about avoiding non-reputable manufacturers and garbage budget models (your $20 skullcandy earbuds probably suck, i'm sorry you had to find out this way), and everything beyond that is mostly preference or real nitpicky audiophile shit.",

        "comment_body": "1. Better balance. Cheaper drivers tend to have too much or too little of bass/mids/treble. Studio monitors aim to be as flat as possible, representing all frequencies as “equally” as possible, while hi-fi will try to have a pleasant listening experience where bass/mids/treble may be more pronounced but not at the expense of muddying or burying the other frequencies (not boomy/boxy/shrill). The worst of the low end simply can’t even reproduce certain frequencies full stop - they’re just not as capable. These are the ones that sound like old radios and announcement systems. They simply can’t recreate the bass and treble frequencies. In sound effects, we mimic these crappy sounding speakers by simply lowering the bass and treble in the EQ controls, which is what those low end speakers essentially do.\n\n2. Better clarity. Better drivers will respond faster and better, and have less distortion. The first one is important because you want a sound to start and stop immediately if they start and stop immediately, not fade in and fade out. If sounds ever so slightly fade in and out, the sound overall becomes muffled and muddles, like how loudspeaker announcements aren’t as easy to understand when you have tons of echo going on. Having poor response can even lead to the creation of sounds that aren’t on the record as the aound waves being created by the driver interact with each other. The second is the driver’s ability to produce sound without breaking up. The simplest example of this is the way you could actually play a vinyl record with a needle and paper. You will hear what’s on it, but it sounds so distorted, because the paper is not able to produce the right frequencies, so it just mostly farts. Good drivers are able to actually reproduce what’s on the recording.\n\n3. Better build quality. Not all high end equipment sadly will have better build quality, as sometimes “high end” simply means fancy, not higher quality. But for truly audio products (not just fashion tech), higher prices often mean better build quality. Cables are thicker and more robust, connectors have thicker and more durable plating, and come in the right size. Enclosures are tuned to how the speakers sound and interact with the air and not just random rectangle cabinets. Materials are selected for their durability and sonic capabilities. Components that are shielded are better shielded, and especially for radio/wireless, less prone to unwanted interference.\n\nAll these will in general basically give the average listener an experience where the sound is very clear and very enjoyable. This is why most people who have never listened with a good sound system will comment “wow I didn’t know it had that voice/instrument” and “I’ve never heard of that before, has it been there all this time?” and especially for headphones and properly set-up stereo systems, “wow it sounds so 3D/realistic, it’s as if I’m on stage/in the studio with the artists”. And that’s because the lower end sound systems simply cannot reproduce the sounds or represent them as well as high end sound systems can.",

        "comment_body": "First, there are 2 main uses for high end speakers/headphones - professional and recreational. \n\nIn this context, professional means that these speakers/headphones are used for music production. They don't have to sound great or pleasant, but they need to represent sound as accurate as possible - so that you could catch an error in the recording early on (for example, microphone starting to go bad). \n\nAnd for recreational use the only requirement is that you like the sound they provide. \n\nSimple example - imagine you want to listen to an old recording from 1940s. It objectively is a bad recording due to limitations of technology back in the day. On professional set of headphones it will sound pretty terrible, just the way it is. But you listen on some higher end recreational headphones and all the crackles may not be as noticeable, the sound imaging may be not as precise so the fact that this recording is mono doesn't bother you as much, etc etc - and at the end listening experience may be more pleasant.\n\nIn terms of how it's being achieved. From technology standpoint, the challenge is to make a speaker that's light enough that it can accurately reproduce all the sounds, even the quiet ones (all the overtones, for example), but have enough rigidity to accurately reproduce articulation as well (if you stand next to the base drum, you can feel the hit on it in your guts - the speakers ideally should be able to reproduce the same effect). After that, if you are targeting professional market, you can stop at being the most accurate sound. For recreational, you need somebody with psychoacoustical knowledge to figure out how exactly you want to \"distort\" the sound to make it more pleasant.",

        "comment_body": "By high-end, I assume you mean expensive.  And assuming it's not a scam, or money put into marketing rather than the product.  There are a few general truths.\n\n1.  Higher end products use more, and more expensive material.  More inert cabinet walls.  More bracing.  Exotic materials.\n\n2.  Higher end products usually look nicer.  Which adds to cost, but doesnt add to sound quality.  \n\n3.  Higher end products may use uncommon designs and mfg techniques, that cost more to make.\n\n4.  Although they should have better build quality and consistency, there's lots of instances where this isn't true.\n\n5.  High end products are often expensive, simply because of lower demand.    \n\n6.  Power handling, mostly for speakers.  The product needs to be more robust in every respect, as you design it to handle more power / play more loudly. \n\n7.  Better electric components.  Such as parts for the crossover.  The main thing with this is not adding to the sound, and tighter tolerances.  The tighter the tolerance, the close it will be to the designers specifications.  With low quality parts, variance can stack to the point of significantly being way out of spec, and changing the characteristic of the intended sound.\n\n8. Generally speaking additional costs and efforts to get a \"high end\" sound is get as close to the intended sound signatures as possible  while eliminating undesired sound artifacts.  On the low end, a cheap cabinet will get you very perceivable cabinet resonance.  On the higher end, you're dealing with things like speaker alignment to get the sound to hit you inphase, all at the same time.  With electronics, you're trying to eliminate distortion and other artifacts that will alter the sound.  And as you guessed, higher quality components and designs will help get you there.\n\nYou'll notice that a number of those points don't necessarily = better sound.  Something can be expensive for many reasons, though there is a general trend with cost to sound quality.  \n\nGiven that, here are somethings to consider when thinking about a product's sound quality \n\n1. Sound is very subjective.  People like different things, and products tend to excel at one thing, at the cost of another. So even a 10000 speaker can sound bad to someone, because they don't like the sound signature. Trust your own ears, rather than what others say.\n\n2.  For speakers, the room it's placed in can significantly alters the sound quality.  People underestimate how much of a factor your room and speaker placement is, to the final resulting sound.  \n\nFor a more specific example, I love my bass.  I want my bass to go very low, tight, flat/impactful, and boosted but not muddle mid range.  This isn't easy to do, and in the headphone world, there are fairly clear price segments where bass quality steps up.",

In classical music it's a high-pitched overtone produced when the violinist only touches the metal string lightly with their finger instead of pressing it down fully, then draws the bow (the 'violin stick') across it. Touching the string lightly in different places produces different pitches (that is, frequencies) of harmonic. I don't know why this is beyond the standard 'because the string is shorter or longer', since my physics is too basic - but I do know from trial and error that the lowest harmonics are nearer the middle of the string and that the highest ones are closer to the two 'ends' of the string. So that's what I understand about harmonics in stringed instruments.\n\nWith harmonics in audio, is a microphone making a harmonic when it makes those horrible shrieking or humming noises, usually when you place it too close to another microphone or a soundspeaker? Or is that something else? Matching technical words to realities ('terms' to 'concepts' in terminology) is like puzzle-solving to me.\n\nI'm assuming also that 'signal' means 'the frequencies that the original LP, audio cassette tape,  CD or digital music file requires at any given moment'... \n\nAre these assumptions correct?

        "comment_body": "Total Harmonic Distortion or THD is based on the relative power of the harmonics compared to the harmonic being measured. Actually, interpreting the number is a bit weird though because it's frequency dependent. Amplifiers and speakers are inherently non-linear devices (this is another topic it has to do with transfer curves), and as such they will all produce some level of distortion. Generally, for stability reasons amplifiers are designed such that will inherently have less distortion at lower frequencies than higher frequencies (again another topic all together as amplifier stability and design has entire books written about it, and speakers are their own can of worms again with books and books). Because of this it is expected that the THD at say 100Hz will be lower than at 10KHz. The saving grace here is that our hearing stops being as effective at the second harmonic of 10KHz which is 20KHz. \n\nThat isn't exactly ELI5, but THD is normally done at 1KHz and it's also normally specified as THD+N or Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise which includes the noise level of things that will often bury some of the really high harmonics in the noise floor. On its own THD doesn't really tell you much other than approximately how linear the device will behave at that frequency, and that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the topic. However, if this information is combined with something called Intermodulation Distortion or IMD (yet another topic for another day, in fact the number of measurements and under what conditions is a whole thing on its own, I believe Rane did a long high level overview and it's still quite a read) it can give a very good indication of how linear something is actually behaving, and from that linearity you can infer how accurate that frequency response graph actually is to what you'll hear. \n\nAgain a bit beyond ELI5, but hopefully with some layman speak of the engineering jargon it makes a bit more sense. These are actually quite deep topics in of themselves to explain what they're doing, how to interpret them, and how to use them either for purchasing decisions or design decisions.",

Maybe harmonics have more audible effect or something.\n\nRight signal is the desired sound, noise is anything else (typically of a random nature, but that's a longer story)\n\nThe microphone shrieking is actually called feedback, where the sound is picked up by a microphone -> plays into speaker -> picked up by a microphone again, but louder -> plays from speaker, but louder -> etc. It becomes a self reinforcing loop that becomes well, a scream. That's why it's so loud. Technically not noise, you could call it an artifact I suppose.\n\nHumming is probably noise, yeah.

        "comment_body": "Well part of it is because of how hard it can be to actually measure THD in the first place. It is pretty easy when it is quite high say around 1 or 5%. But take a modern jelly bean audio DAC. Its THD is going to be on the order of about 0.00025% or about -112dB. You need a very linear and low noise system to measure this in the first place. Sure, top end modern audio DACs and ADCs are approaching physical limits (i.e. what physics says can and can't be done). But as you increase bandwidth one thing that needs to increase as well is its inherent noise. So, if you want to measure THD at ever higher frequencies than you can't have just one system that does it, you'd need more than one. And these are not cheap systems. Something like an Audio Precision unit is going to set you back five figures and it is only good up to about 200KHz or so. \n\n\\* Edit One thing I forgot to mention here is the need for a Sine Wave. Sure, the math of one is simple enough. But generating just sinusoidal waveform? In the digital realm, modern DACs can push down to around the measurement floor. Analog ones tend to end up around -130dB. To accurately measure THD you really want your signal source to be at least one order of magnitude better than what you're measuring. Well, if what you're measuring is already -130dB THD and your source is barely any better? Yeah the task becomes too difficult and there really isn't much to do. For a great many modern parts that is the sort of realm of performance things are getting to.\n\nThe other issue is most consumers simply wouldn't know how to interpret them all that well. It is just a lot of numbers, and really THD on its own is not super telling. It is only when viewed in the context of other specifications does it carry any significance. Further, THD is not a specification that says how something will sound. Why is that my HD600s sound warmer than my HD800S? From THD alone it wouldn't tell you that. But looking at THD along with frequency, sensitivity, impedance curves, group delay, IMD, etc... I can get a better idea of how they'll sound, but I won't know for sure until I put them on with a competent headphone output and decent DAC with material I know well.\n\nSo, the tl;dr is that it gets very costly to actually perform the measurements and to most consumers it doesn't really indicate anything other than a simple metric of roughly how linear it is.\n\nJust as a funzie, if you want to see specifications done generally right, and lots of them then take a look at [Neumman's Monitors](https://www.neumann.com/en-gb/products/monitors/kh-120-ii). From that you can glean a lot of info. Most notably is that around 60Hz or so the ports on them will cause frequencies in that region to ring a little longer, but a reasonable compromise for the size of the speaker. What it won't show you though is the breakup mode around 7-8KHz on the tweeter which is most noticeable with sibilance, at least with the original models. I haven't heard the A variant. Outside of that they're fantastic small speakers, but I upgraded to some big passive 3-ways.\n\nEdit - As an aside. Something like a tube amp sounds good, and they often have THD in the 1% or higher range. Sometimes some distortion just sounds good. I know I experimented with a VCA volume controls a while ago, and just for the lulz I tried a paralleled set of CEM3360s. They pushed something like 1.5% THD or such. But boy did they sound *good*. There was just this little bit of extra edge to everything that was actually quite pleasant.",

So, on average, they pocket $20 for every 10 people that signed up?\n\nSo it sounds like the insurance company is just making a ton of money here without really giving anyone anything. Why would people sign up? Well, if you only have $50 in your pocket, you maybe would prefer paying $12 guaranteed rather than needing to maybe pay $100 tomorrow, as that would put you in debt.\n\nAnother way to think of insurance is: everyone pays a little into a money pot, and that pool of money is then used whenever any of the people that paid in need it to cover a specific kind of expense everyone agreed on in advance.",

For 90% of riders each year, this is a cost of $144 for essentially zero benefit. But for 10% of riders, it is a cost of $144 that saves them from paying $1200, a net savings of $1056. Any given motorcyclist has about a 57% chance (1-0.9^8) of having an accident in 8 years, but the cost of 8 years of insurance is only $1152. That means, for more than half of riders, it is advantageous to buy insurance, even though the vast majority of them won't have a problem in any given year.\n\nAssume there are 1000 motorcycle riders who buy insurance. The insurance company thus pays out 100x$1200 = $120,000 each year to claimants who get injured (because 10% of 1000 is 100). But the insurance company *collects* $144x1000 = $144,000 each year. As a result, even after paying out the insurance claims to the yearly claimants, the insurance company still makes $24,000 profit each year.\n\nIn actual stuff, insurance companies do things like checking your history (medical history, driving history, etc.), estimating the risks, etc., etc., in order to give you a rate that is profitable for them--usually *very* profitable in the long run.",

This would be a disaster for you, because rebuilding it or buying a new home costs a lot of money. It would take you decades to save enough.\n\nTo protect yourself against this risk you buy insurance.\n\nYou pay a monthly or annual \"premium\" to an insurance company. Lots of other people do the same. If your house does burn down the insurer will pay the cost of rebuilding it (provided you meet their policy terms & conditions).\n\nNow whether or not *your* house will have a fire in a given year is impossible to predict. But because of \"the law of large numbers\" a company that insures 100,000 houses can estimate fairly accurately how many fires there will be and how much they will have to pay out. Insurers are required to have \"reserves\" to make sure they can pay out, even if things turn out rather worse than they expected (they can also buy \"reinsurance\" to help with this).\n\nHow does the insurance company make money? Two main ways. First, by charging more in premiums than their costs. Second, by investing money.\n\nNow you might ask \"why should I buy insurance if (on average) companies pay out less than they take in?\" Well go back to how long it would take to save up to rebuild a house. *If* you're ok paying £50k to rebuild your house or £500 to replace your smartphone, then you probably don't need insurance.",

You *could* try to save up money for it, but that's a lot of money sitting around doing nothing. A better thing to do with your money is to invest it in stocks, or loan it out and collect interest. There are two problems with that: if you need money, you won't have it because you'll have to liquidate your investments; and, investing is way more effective if you have a lot of money to invest.\n\nInsurance companies collect a little bit of money from a *lot* of people, so they have a *lot* of money. They can then invest a lot of that money and collect interest, while still having enough to cover the relatively few individuals who need a payout.\n\nIt's also a way of *socializing* cost associated with risk. That is, rather than expect individuals to save and collect the large amount of money needed for emergencies, we can spread that cost out among a large group of people to make the cost relatively small for each person. The money from the healthy people with functional cars and a not burned down house are paying for the people who need help.\n\nThe insurance companies do a lot of math to figure out what they should charge. They consider how much on average it costs to pay out and the likelihood of paying out or how often, historically, they pay out, how many customers they can expect to get, and what customers seem willing to pay. They charge a little bit more than they expect to pay out, so they make a profit (plus, whatever they bring in from loaning money out and investing).",

If you are a small insurer a catastrophe can wipe you out (for example you sell hail protection and a huge hailstorm comes through a few states, leading to multiple claims at the same time), small insurers usually buy insurance of their own for these cases.\n\n3) Insurers do not keep the money in a pot where inflation eats at it, the money is invested in financial assets.

As you say, ponzi (or other pyramid investment) schemes collect investment from new investors and use that money to pay out existing investors. They're on a constant drive to bring in increasing amounts of cash, and it's inevitable that they'll collapse when new investors dry up. They have to maintain the confidence of existing investors so they don't choose to pull out funds.\n\nInsurers, on the other hand, can continue indefinitely without having to expand in that way. Unlike ponzi schemes insurers should have enough reserves and reinsurance to pay out in likely claim scenarios. They are (in most developed countries) quite closely regulated to ensure this is the case. And unlike ponzi schemes insurance customers can't choose to get a pay out - they're only eligible if something bad happens to them. (Of course insurers can still collapse if badly run or in some unprecedented circumstances, and insurers generally *want* to keep expanding, but that's true of any business.)",

That is additional air pressure on top the standard air pressure at sea level of 14.7 psi. So adding a turbocharger to an engine's air intake could yield up to 30% more air while a supercharger could yield up to 40% more air being pushed into the engine.\n\nRunning into a strong wind? Without some measurements and actually knowing wind speed, direction, and some other stuff that my brain is too tired to think of right now, I'd give the runner a 1 to 2% increase in air volume.\n\nWhat complicates this comparison even more is that there isn't a computer timing control on our lungs and heart like there is on the combustion system of an engine. There are lots of measurements being taken on the air intake of a turbocharged or supercharged car, that data is computed very fast and the fuel injectors spray a precise amount of fuel into the combustion chamber of the cylinder that is as close to optimal as possible for the amount of air present to produce the most efficient BANG.\n\nSpeaking of air in the lungs transferring to hemoglobin in the blood via the pulmonary system, there are so many more factors that dictate whether our bodies can even use the oxygen efficiently... Cardiovascular health, the presence of the necessary fuel that our muscles need to perform optimally, the amount of waste product that needs to be moved away from the muscles to keep them functioning at their peak, **an so much more**.\n\nAt the end of the day, engines are far more simple and have far fewer parameters for optimal energy production than our bodies do.

My rudimentary remark was targeted at the \"unlike air pumps\" statement. Whether it's a centrifugal fan, or a positive displacement compressor, there is certainly lots of \"dead space\" and a lot of variables at play to loading besides a pressure value. Machines have different breathing problems, but they are still there. You're just ignorant of them, like I'm ignorant of all things pulmonary. Not a big deal. I may be clueless about the applicability and actual physiological effects of CPAPs, but that's absolutely irrelevant because it's a bogus analogy. \n\nWhen you strap a CPAP to someone's face, a machine is doing work against a sealed system to move a greater mass of air into a certain volume, *increasing* density and static pressure(potential energy) relative to ambient. When a mass of air is set in motion in the atmosphere, its static pressure *decreases* as potential energy converts to kinetic energy. When the air eventually comes back to rest, whether from hitting a brick wall, your front teeth, the bottom of your lungs, etc., it can only re-expand to its original static pressure, at best. But the reality is that it will have lost some amount of kinetic energy to friction, so final static will be less than when it started! There's no mystical ram-air unicorn here. The only way this works is if there is some external source adding energy to the air, like someone pulling a giant fan in front of OP and blowing air in their face.\n\nMy belief is that any net benefits are due only to the fact that you are approaching an area of higher static pressure, as I said in the beginning. Wind speed is irrelevant except as an indicator of how bad of a low pressure pocket you were previously in. Calm air in the middle of a high pressure zone is better than air at any speed along its gradient.\n\nIf I'm misguided, hopefully a physicist will be kind enough to come along and set me straight. But in the meantime, you seem exceedingly confident you're qualified to thoroughly answer OP's question beyond debate, so how about enlightening the community with precisely how \"stiff\" of a direct headwind you think would be necessary to make any measurable *net* improvement OP's blood oxygen level?  In your response, please account for the metabolic expense of running with greater aerodynamic drag. The bulk of those forces will be pushing directly against the chest and abdomen, so please expound on the therapeutic benefits of that as well. Since it's November, let's also consider the wind chill and the resultant change in oxygen demand from thermogenesis. Feel free to add any other factors you deem relevant.

        "comment_body": "Some of the answer depends on if you're talking about cell phones or landline phones. \n\nIn both cases, no. Landline phones have no concept of a number for reasons that will be explained. Neither do cell phones, though how they get a number assigned is different.\n\nFor landline phones, historically your number literally indicated which wire in a switchboard was connected to your house. It worked like this:\n\n* Someone who wanted to make a call would turn a crank to \"call\" the operator, a person at the switchboard.\n* This would make a light next to their connector turn on. The operator would plug their phone into that line and ask who they wanted to call.\n* Then the operator would plug a wire from that connector to the connector for the number they wanted.\n* This would make the receiving person's phone ring. \n\nNow digital equipment tends to do that job, but it's still generally true that there is a wire from your house to some equipment somewhere. So ANY landline phone that plugs into your phone jack \"has\" the number, but in reality what's happening is the wires in the house \"have\" the number.\n\n(There are no-wire ways this can work but it's effectively the same as...)\n\nCell phones don't have wires. Getting a number is the job of the SIM card. Technically it doesn't have a phone number, it has a more complicated ID. When you buy a plan, the cell company is basically configuring their network to understand if someone calls a certain number, the network needs to send that call to the phone with your SIM. So in theory if you move your SIM to another phone, now that phone uses your number. (Some complications may require you to contact your carrier to make that happen.) \n\nSo it's kind of like how the internet works. When someone calls a phone number, that call goes to something that has to figure out how to connect the call. It has to ask, \"Where does this number go?\" If it goes to a landline network, some equipment somewhere understands how to connect a circuit to the wires in the house with the number. If it goes to a cellular network, some equipment somewhere looks to see if a SIM card is associated with that number and if any cell tower it knows of can reach that SIM card. \n\nThere are some exceptions! Cell phones (at least in the US) can make emergency 911 calls even if there is no SIM card. Technically you have no phone number when this happens, but technically the cell network doesn't *need* your phone number to PLACE a call. This is only mandated for 911, if you try to place other calls they are likely to fail. In theory, I'm sure a carrier like Verizon can place a call to a phone with no number by directly telling equipment to connect a call to a SIM, but in reality mere mortals are not going to be able to call a cell phone if it has no assigned number. That's more of a diagnostic trick you get for being an admin.",

        "comment_body": ">Why don't we use NVDIMM/NVRAM for storage if it's as fast as RAM and keeps data after the machine is shut off?\n\nBecause NVDIMM/NVRAM usually isn't actually as fast as DRAM and, depending on the technology, significantly more slower when it comes to writing of data.\n\nWhen it comes to storage like this there are two main concerns - read/write speeds and latency.  With read/write speeds you are mainly concerned with how much data you can read or write to the storage either sequentially or randomly after you have gotten the media ready for reading or writing.  Latency (the time between cause and effect) is a bit more complicated as it generally involves far more than just your media - for example, for DDR5 you have your memory controller with it's latency between a read request from the CPU and when it starts to request that data from the DDR5 DIMMs and you also have the latency involved in the actual addressing and reading of data from the DIMMs - it is way to complicated to get into for a ELI5 post and doubly so when the ELI5 isn't specifically about it but it is something to take into account.\n\nNVDIMM/NVRAM may have had sequential read speeds approaching that of DRAM but it has a much higher latencies and random access read speeds.  It also usually has significantly slower read speeds in comparison to DRAM but this mainly comes down to the technology used for the NV storage.\n\nFor example, Intel's last Optane DIMMs operated with DDR5 memory controllers on certain 4th gen Xeon Scalable CPUs (code-named Sapphire Rapids) - they were slated for a 2023 release date but were never actually launched.  Their maximum read performance was a mere 8.96 GB/s while regular old DDR5-4400 DIMMs had a effective memory bandwidth of 58.81 GB/s.  The write performance of the Optane DIMMs was a abysmal maximum of 1.63 GB/s while performing 100% writes while the DDR5 DIMMs retained most of their 58.81 GB/s of bandwidth while writing.  The only benefit that Optane DIMMs gave you was the non-volatile feature as there were 512GB DDR5 Registered DIMMs available before this generation of Optane DIMMs came out.  What likely put the final nails in the coffin of Intel's Optane venture was both Intel's worsening financial performance due to increased competition from AMD and fab issues, and the fact that NAND-based storage drives were approaching the performance of Optane even if they lacked the endurance ratings and random Input/Output Per Second (IOPS) performance of Optane.\n\n>Why is NVDIMM/NVRAM only used for certain things instead of like storage?\n\nNVDIMM/NVRAM were used for certain applications because those applications gain a massive benefit from having large amounts of relatively high speed non-volatile storage for data.  Unfortunately NVDIMMs failed to keep pace with SSD technology and now you can get SSD drives that perform almost as well while providing significantly more storage per drive - the \"almost as well\" mostly comes down to random read performance and higher latencies due to SSDs using NAND rather than technologies like Optane.  You can also build up the performance and overall capacity of the SSD storage by adding more drives to your server while you are limited when adding in new DIMMs.\n\n>Also, I'm using NVDIMM and NVRAM interchangeably, but is there a difference?\n\nNVRAM refers to a class of nonvolatile random access storage while NVDIMMs are a type of NVRAM that are in a DIMM form factor.\n\nI should note that I am really rooting for non-volatile RAM to actually come to fruition due to the massive benefits can provide to consumers.  Imagine being able to turn your computer completely off with no power at all being consumed and then plugging it back in and have it be at the same state that it was when you turned it off almost instantly.  It would be game changing for laptops because you could have pretty much instant on and off capabilities (you still need to initialise the hardware but that could be overcome with time).  Battery ran flat when you were out and about?  Well, all that work you were doing but forgot to save would still be right there once you plugged your laptop back in.  The only real negatives would be when you want to actually reboot to a clean state which would require the NVRAM to be cleared and the fact that your computer would still have all your potentially sensitive data sitting on the DIMMs if it suddenly lost power.",

        "comment_body": "First of all Japan doesn't have a currency that works like dollars and cents. The Yen works like cents and has no equivalent of a dollar, so automatically you can take two zeros off the price of everything.\n\nAnother problem is that the interest rates in Japan are the lowest in the developed world. Japan actually had negative interest rates for while.\n\nEconomically Japan is a really weird country by our standards. People save a lot of money, culturally they are strongly opposed to price increases on anything (making it very hard for companies to raise prices and salaries) and it's really hard to get them to spend and invest.\n\nThe very low interest rates were an attempt to get people and companies to borrow money, any money, and trying to cause inflation in Japan.\n\nWomen in Japan (who traditionally are in charge of the family finances) started taking advantage to borrow money at almost no interest and invest it in foreign currencies waiting for the Yen to devalue, then would sell it to make money. This was referred to by the media as 'Mrs Watanabe'. With interest rates climbing you can't do this anymore and many women were caught out, stuck with loans they had to rapidly pay off.\n\nJapan is in the midst of a population crisis with an aging population. Wages are stagnant, and they are having shortages of employees in the job market.\n\nThey also aren't allowing in a lot of immigrants to stem the tide like in North America.\n\nSo they are in an economic slump.\n\nJapan is also in the midst of a political crisis. They are effectively a 1-party system as the Democratically elected LDP has ruled over Japan almost continuously for nearly a century. They recently dropped to a minority government over some scandals so it's going to be that much harder for the already notoriously conservative Japanese government to pass laws and change policy.\n\nThe good news is tourism is booming. After a slump during the pandemic Japan is open to tourists again and the weak Yen means tourist dollars go further.\n\nBut the public is pushing back against this too calling it 'over tourism' as Western tourists are constantly shown on the news disrupting the lives Japanese and making an ass of themselves. A number of famous Youtubers made trips to Japan in the past year and did a bunch of stupid stunts for views and it made the situation a lot worse.\n\nOnly a small percentage of tourists are the problem, but the notoriously conservative and xenophobic Japanese love taking a hammer to the problem and have started banning foreigners from visit parts of the country.",

No it doesn't impact its strength (directly at least)\n\nSo in general the exchange rate to dollar compared to other currencys doesn't say anything about how strong that currency is.

As an example, the Ghibli museum in Tokyo sells tickets for about 1000 yen, an extremely cheap price, despite demand being so high that people have to be on their website at a precise time when they're released if they want a chance of buying one. It's like if Disneyland sold tickets for 40 bucks and they sold out all the time minutes after being released. Maybe that's a Ghibli thing but when I was in Japan I felt like many things could have easily been sold for more.",

(They still have to pay credit spreads). When interest rates are negative, technically you should be charged a fee for putting money in your deposit account. In reality, banks cannot do this because people would just hoard money. What this means is that it actually costs banks to hold your money even if they pay you zero interest. \n\nTo offset this, banks end up lending our money to companies at very low rates. Because holding cash actually costs money it is cheaper to lend it out even at zero interest. This means companies can access low and affordable financing. Which means they can invest in new projects and be more productive. They can also employ more people on these projects who now have more income to spend on things. Those people can also get mortgages at low rates so they have even more money to spend on things. They keep buying things and companies keep borrowing to invest in new things for them to buy. As a result, the economy grows! \n\nJapan has a weak economy and years of disinflation so their long held policy of negative interest rates is to stimulate growth. It’s not unique by the way, Europe has had negative interest rates for years and interest rates overall have been very low pre covid. They have only had to increase them in recent years because a combination of covid impact on supply chains, Ukraine war and surplus of consumer cash from covid led to massive inflation. To combat this, interest rates were hiked to stop all the things mentioned above (new projects/new jobs) and slow down the economy. \n\nNow they are cutting rates to ensure there is no recession? But if there is (because they have not cut rates quickly enough) then we will likely see negative interest rates again to encourage cheap borrowing and stimulate the economy. ",

We're currently here, and the cycle may or may not break, we'll see the result by 2027/2031.\n\nA corruption scandal makes people lose faith in the previous president and they vote for the candidate who shouts \"I'm not like him\" the loudest.

It was a “breadbasket” nation. \n\nBut then two things happened: the Haber-Bosch process massively increased global agricultural output, reducing demand for Argentina’s main exports; and the Panama Canal opened, reducing the number of ships calling at Argentinian ports.\n\nOK - but those factors alone do not explain it. Neighbouring Uruguay and Chile have both done relatively well, especially Uruguay. Even Brazil has had more growth than Argentina. \n\nSo, other factors:\n\n- immigration reduced, limiting the supply of workers\n- under Peron, Argentina followed a left-populist economic ideology that differed from orthodox Marxism and has been called syndicalist. They also pursued autarky rather than making use of comparative advantage, driving up the cost of living for Argentinians because Peron focused on labour interests.\n- the two military junta, like almost all military coups, was very bad for the economy. Business likes the rule of law, not the whims of the military who keep torturing suspected dissidents.\n- Argentina has had a persistent problem with corruption: Peron meddled with the courts and bribed union leaders, his wife (who was by then the President) had a secretary who was embezzling money to fund an anti communist death squad, and the junta of course were corrupt to their teeth. The first democratically-elected president after the 1970s junta was Raul Alfonsin, who was steadfast on anti-corruption and human rights but couldn’t control inflation - he knew what he had to do, but couldn’t get the support to do it.\n- Alfonsin was replaced by Carlos Menem, who was extremely pragmatic and willing to be unpopular. He privatised state industries, stood up to the unions, cut spending and raised taxes. This got inflation under control, increased foreign investment, cut interest rates, and saw a big increase in GDP. One problem: unemployment increased, leading to riots in some states. Additionally, Menem was very corrupt. Corruption is toxic to the economy because it undermines fairness and the rule of law - i.e. the richest triumph over the best.\n- since then, Argentina has fairly consistently been ruled by the Kirchners and their followers, who are left-wing Peronists. They’re both corrupt as fuck and incompetent governors who aren’t prepared to take meaningful steps to tackle inflation, and allowed the state to balloon in size.\n- the new-ish President is Javier Milei, who is deeply eccentric. A lot of his ideas would be suicide in a stable country but might actually do some good in Argentina, where everything is shit.",

Conservatives called anything they don't like socialism, and then Bernie came around and said, \"Hey progressives, you know all those boilerplate democratic policies we like? Well guess what, that actually is socialism! Ya see, socialism is actually a good thing. If you like the Nordic system, you like socialism too.\" It was always dumb when conservatives conflated democratic policies with socialism, and it was just as dumb when Bernie did the same to try to make socialism more palitiable to the general public. Strong unions, workers rights, and a robust welfare state are perfectly compatible with capitalism.\n>The problem with a market economy is that it's all about profit.\n\n\nGod forbid an economy prioritizes enriching it's citizens. Where do you think these profits go? Into a black hole? I expect businesses to prioritize profits, and I expect my government to ensure worker's rights and that everyone in society is provided for. \n>Every social welfare program is society's response to the failure of the market to provide essential services.\n\n\nI completely agree! Anyone who believes that the market solves all of societies problems is also wildly ignorant. Anyone who doesn't believe in market failures is also ignorant. An easy example of this is how the market doesn't properly price in the cost of climate change in the energy market, which is exactly why governments should impose a tax on carbon.\n\n\nI strongly support welfare programs, I just want them funded by a capitalistic system. It seems that everyone agrees that the US is the richest country in the world, and even Karl Marx recognizes capitalism as an important vehicle for economic growth, so why not retain such a system and use it to fund welfare, instead of dismantling the system in favor of a system without a single real world example of success, but a laundry list of abject failures?",

Eventually they had to form an alliance with the other liberal parties for the presidential elections, which led to Mauricio Macri of the third party Republican Proposal getting elected.\n\nThe President has a fair amount of executive power and Milei has got quite a bit of his agenda implemented (although he doesn't have a legislative majority), but it remains to be seen whether Argentinians will like him at the end of his first term. While there's some positive signs on inflation, there are serious trade-offs: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-cuts-interest-rate-inflation-outlook-eases-2024-11-01/",

In ELI5 terms, this gives them an idea of how much \"extra income\" you have to make additional loan payments. Usually a bank will take your income and allow something like 40-50% of it as a maximum loan payment. So in your case 50% of your income is 75,000. Then it will deduct from that 75,000 all current loan payments. For example if you have car loan payments of 15,000 a year, then the difference (75,000-15,000) is 60,000. It will not give you a loan that has payments greater than 60,000 a year. This gets complicated as the \"income\" should consider your tax liability too. Whether or not you should take that sum is for you to consider as the banks want to lend you as much as they can but your lifestyle might not allow you to borrow that much money.\n\nIt will also consider your home equity IF you are willing to pledge it as collateral for any new loans.

Two distinct solids won't transfer energy between each other nearly as well as gas would.

If they're too thick, the vibrations don't result in meaningful pressure waves because the solid doesn't bounce up and down enough to push the air.

There is only so much blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc in the area immediately surrounding the tumor. If it stayed in the same place it would eventually reach a growth limit. So if it wants to keep growing, it eventually finds a way to break through the membranes of whenever it is and travel through the bloodstream to grow somewhere else\n\n\n\nLong answer:\n\nCells have DNA. Some parts of the DNA are responsible for telling cells how often they should divide.\n\nWhen DNA is damaged, it's called a mutation. Mutations can be caused by toxins (eg. tobacco, alcohol), the environment (eg. sun exposure, radiation) or cell division (cells can mess up while dividing).\n\nIf a mutation occurs in the part of the DNA that's responsible for telling the cell how often it should divide, you get cancer- cells that will divide inappropriately or in an uncontrolled way.\n\nHowever, remember how one of the ways mutations occur is during cell division? Well if a cancerous cell is dividing uncontrollably, it increases the chance that mutations occur. These mutations can occur anywhere in the DNA which means all sorts of normal cell functions are at risk.\n\nCancer cells eventually get the ability to produce their own blood supply, suppress local immune function, ignore normal nutrition needs, etc. Another very common mutation they acquire is metastasis. That is, the mutate to the point that they ignore the blueprint for normal tissue structure. They break free from the organized cells around them, breakdown surrounding connective tissue and eventually end up in the blood stream where they are carried somewhere else in the body.\n\nWhere they implant and grow next often has to do with what sort of cell the cancer started out as. Different cells are more \"compatible\" with certain organs.\n\nSOURCE: whatever I remembered from my 500 level biology of cancer class lol",

Cells like that ended up becoming things like your bone marrow. When you're wounded, skin cells can also do that - they physically get up and move and try to cover the empty spot. \n\n Because all your cells have the same DNA, all of your cells *could* in theory do that too. The process is called the **epithelial-mesenchymal transition**, if you want to look up that in more detail. It's quite a complicated set of changes that isn't worth getting into for ELI5.\n\n In cancer, mutations happen that cause the cancer cells to re-learn how to do that, so the cell can now break off, resist dying due to breaking away, and when it floats past a site that it likes, it can stick back on, slide in and start dividing forever.",

These single cells evolved gradually into multicellular life, so that first they were merely just a bunch of standalone cells stuck together. In every step of the evolution, these single cells gave up some of their freedom, and one freedom is that it actually loses the ability of being free. Most cells in our body do require being attached to their buddies, if they get de-attached, they die. Yet, up to this day, most cells in our body still have all abilities to return to single cell mode.       \n\nA cancer happens when a cell loses these controls due to damage of its DNA where the program for the control was stored. DNA damage is random and in most cases cells after damage just die, but if the damage hits parts that are needed to keep the cell in bay, the cell becomes cancerous.           \n\nSo basically when a cell becomes cancerous, it starts going backwards on the evolutionary pathway, not necessarily in order, and keeps losing those traits. And at a point it may or may not reach the single cell state when it just becomes a wandering cell without the need of any attachment to other cells. At this point the cancer forms metastasis, which is just cells de-attaching from the cancer, wandering around and keep multiplying in corners where they cannot wander any further.",

This is a messy process—while a random sample of people should theoretically be representative of a larger whole, lots of factors (like what kind of people are likely to pick up the phone and talk to a pollster, or the fact that not everyone votes) mean that if you just take the raw poll result at face value, there's a good chance you'll be way off.  \n  \nSo pollsters weight their polls—they look at the random sample of people they got and change how much weight different types of peoples' answers have to match what they think the real electorate will actually look like. For example, if you poll 500 people and only reach 200 Republicans, but in past years Republicans have made up 43-47% of the electorate in a given state, you might assign more weight to the answers you got from Republicans so your sample matches that. This involves some level of educated guesswork, because no two elections see the exact same people turn out.  \n  \nHerding is when pollsters look at the other polls being released and either don't release polls of their own that look like outliers, or they change how they're weighting the poll to change the composition of the electorate so that their result is closer to what other people are saying. It's not really a defensible thing to do statistically (good polling *should* produce outliers sometimes because it's an expected artifact of having a low sample size compared to the total group), but you can sort of see why someone might do it—if everyone is saying \"this election is 50/50\" and you get a poll result that says one candidate is actually up by 7, it takes a lot of guts to release that result and stand out from the crowd.  \n  \nEspecially when polls have often missed in recent years—famously underestimating Trump in 2016 and 2020, and underestimating Democrats in 2022—it can be easy for pollsters to second-guess themselves. We've seen a lot of pretty clear herding this year (we can tell because, as mentioned above, there *should* be a lot more noise and outliers, and normally are) because of pollsters being unwilling to stand out from the crowd, and it makes it difficult to tell if the election is *really* about 50/50 or if there's a feedback loop where people are less wiling to release polls that deviate from what \"looks right\".",

You're so far off from everyone else, clearly you must've made a mistake somewhere! So you go back and tweak the numbers until you also get a number close to 50 like everyone else.\n\nThat's essentially what poll herding is: tweaking how the data in polls is collected, aggregated, and weighted to make it match what everyone else is getting. The problem is that if a *lot* of people are poll herding, then it means we have no clue if it's accurate. They're simply all fudging their numbers to get what they *think* is the correct consensus.",

Suppose a pollster obtained a result saying 'Trump + 8' or 'Harris + 8'. \n\nGiven all the other polls are very close, the pollster might say \"Well, this is completely out of step with all the other polls. I guess what's happened is that we've accidentally over-polled certain demographics that favour one side over the other, or the ones we DID poll are not representative for some reason. But if I assign this demographic a lower weighting in my calculations, I now get a Tie. That fits in with what everyone else is saying, so that must be the correct way to handle this\".\n\nThis is 'herding' in its purest form. Note that it is not necessarily a BAD thing....it could legitimately be that the pollster obtained an unrepresentative sample by chance, and that gave them a freak result. Massaging the weighting of demographics was the 'right' thing to do to get an accurate result. \n\nWhere herding becomes interesting is where the election result really does turn out to be a Trump or Harris + 8. Then you sometimes get pollsters after the fact admitting \"Actually we DID get Trump + 8 in our last poll, but we didn't think it was correct so we didn't report it like that\". \n\nThese scenarios raise questions about how true or accurate polling really is, and/or can also raise conspiracy-type arguments about 'pollsters putting their fingers on the scale to push Their Side'",

Every single poll had her with a 10 point lead, comfortable majority in the parliament etc.\n\nThen YouGov published a poll (UK uses 650 constituencies to elect the parliament) which used a MRP methodology to model how different constituencies would likely vote due to their demographic make-up etc. That showed that the outcome was likely to be a hung parliament (i.e. no one party winning 50%+1 of the constitutencies to form a government without votes or abstentions from other parties). The Conservatives were still the largest party, but short of the 326 they'd need to form a Government.

Mix it up in stomach acid. Acid breaks things down into smaller molecules, untangles proteins, and turns on a stomach enzyme called pepsin. Pepsin starts chewing up proteins into individual building blocks called amino acids. \n\n3. Un-acidify that stomach acid-food mix, called chyle, on its way into the small intestine.\n\n4. Squirt enzymes from the pancreas into the small intestine. This is where the bulk of the work gets done: enzymes called amylases, proteases, and lipases go to town breaking everything up into tiny bits.\n\n5. Squirt bile from the gallbladder into the mix. Fats and water don't mix, and you're mostly water. Bile makes it so you can digest your fats. \n\n6. The fats get absorbed directly into your lymphatic system.\n\n7. The proteins and carbs get picked up by amino acid and glucose transporters.\n\n8. The rest, mostly stuff you can't digest passes along into the large intestine. You suck out the water from it. Bacteria break bits down and you absorb those bits. This is where farts are made. \n\n9. Poop\n\nThe fats mostly go to fat cells for storage. The amino acids and glucoses go mostly to your liver first. Glucoses get turned into glycogen for storage. Amino acids don't have a storage mode so they get turned into protein, shipped out, or used straight away. \n\nWhen you need some energy, glycolysis (for carbs), proteolysis (for proteins) or lipolysis (for fats) breaks the stored versions down all the way into a chemical called Acetyl CoA\n\nThat goes into something horrible called the Krebs cycle. A teacher will one day make you memorise it. You will forget it. By not telling you what it is, we can skip a step and you can forget about it in advance. \n\nWhat's important is a few chemicals get made: ATP, FADH and NADH. ATP is your cells energy cash that it spends to do things like make enzymes do stuff or operate pumps. Having *some* is good, but we need a ton.\n\nEnter oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nNADH and FADH carry electrons into something creatively called the electron transport chain. It happens in the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. \n\nIn short, their electrons get shuttled along to power tiny machines that pump hydrogen ions out of the mitochondria. The last step is a tiny turbine that is powered by letting the hydrogen ions flow back inside through it, only instead of making electricity, it makes more ATP; cell energy. \n\nATP stands for Adenosine Tri-Phosphate. ATP fuels things by handing out energy when you snap off the P.",

        "comment_body": "You know how when something is on fire, it releases energy in the form of light and heat? Your body is doing largely the same thing, but much slower.\n\nIn some materials, breaking the bonds between atoms releases energy. The equation goes both ways. For example:\n\nSugar + oxygen <=> carbon dioxide + water + energy\n\n(Edit: the previous version of this post had “energy” on both sides, which was a mistake! Thanks to commenters for pointing that out)\n\nWhen plants do photosynthesis, they take in water, CO2, and energy from sunlight. They use that energy to rearrange the CO2 and water molecules into sugar and O2. Then they store the sugar, or do more chemistry to it to make other things in their bodies.\n\nThe opposite process is respiration. Plants do this themselves, rearranging that stored sugar, plus some O2, into CO2 and water. This releases energy that the plant can use to do things like grow or make seeds. If we eat the plant instead, we can also do respiration, taking the plant’s sugar, combining it with O2, and getting energy, CO2, and water. If the plant instead burns, like wood in a fireplace, the same reaction happens—just all at once.\n\nThis can happen with sugar, or with other materials like proteins and fats. We and other living things can also convert different materials into each other. When we eat food, some of that we can combine with oxygen and use for energy; some if it we can’t but the microbes in our intestines can; some of it we can’t and passes through is; and small amounts of it are other substances we absorb not to use for fuel, but to incorporate into our bodies.",

Other bacteria can capture energy from other chemical processes.   \n  \nOther species use even weirder energy sources, though perhaps not as their only or main source of energy.

Think of it like a fractal if that helps.\n\nThe largest blood vessels are the arteries and veins closest to the heart, like the aorta and vena cava.\n\nThey branch into primary veins and arteries. You might have heard of the pulmonary vein, carotid artery, femoral artery, etc. \n\nThen those branch into smaller veins and arteries, like the brachial, tibial and many many others. These more well-known terms tend to be the more superficial ones and/or focused on the limbs. But there are entire vascular systems that feed your organs and follow the same fundamental branching pattern, like the hepatic, renal, mesenteric systems.\n\nThese eventually branch into arterioles and venules (basically quite narrow arteries and veins but are structurally a little different). At this point you aren't really going to see these through the skin. The smallest blood vessels you'll see on your own body are probably the veins in the hand or foot.\n\nThose arterioles and values keep dividing until you get capillaries, which are so small that the vessel walls are a single cell thick. These are the vessels where gas exchange takes place because oxygen and carbon dioxide (along with exchange of other molecules) can diffuse across those ultra-thin vessel walls. It's not all passive diffusion but that's a whole other post.\n\nThat's *basically* how your blood vessels work. Without over-complicating things, the purpose of all the branches are just to efficiently transport blood from one set of capillaries to another. The capillaries are where all the action happens.\n\nSo, to answer your question, a superficial cut will only damage superficial blood vessels. Having lots of large blood vessels right under your skin is... not ideal. So, it's an evolutionary advantage to have larger blood vessels protected aka as deep as possible under your other tissues. Your outer layer of skin is basically only housing capillaries and, a little deeper, you'll see some arterioles and venules. \n\nYes, there are some larger veins that \"pop out\" a bit but that's basically because there's not much room in some areas of your limbs, especially considering how they need to bypass joints. Notice there are no visible veins in your torso, where there's tons of protected space for blood vessels to run. Arteries tend to not be superficial, which is good because damaging those is relatively much more catastrophic.",

That means it cuts through mostly capillaries, where the blood is being squeezed through tiny spaces. All of those sliced capillaries start gushing blood, but there's not a whole lot *in* them--and then the exposure to the air almost immediately begins the coagulation process, putting thin patches over the holes. As the blood dries, it becomes a better and better layer of protection.\n\nThe pain, likewise, comes from the extremely high density of nerve endings in the hands, where most paper cuts occur. Your hands, feet, face, and genitals have *by far* the highest density of nerve endings of any part of your body--to the point that the \"sensory homunculus\", a little figure where the scale of body parts is based on how many nerve endings are present there, has *absolutely hilariously* oversized hands and feet, while its arms, legs, and torso are barely even present. So when you get even a very small cut on your hands, it's cutting through MANY nerve endings, sending more intense signals to your body. By comparison, you need a much larger cut anywhere on your arms, legs, or torso in order to feel anywhere near as much pain.",

This disgestion usually takes alot of time, thus the energy wouldn't be available for a while, and would only be introduced to the bloodstream slowly. Our bodies were designed for this process.\n\nBut, when we eat refined sugars, which is basically pure glucose, it is very rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. Glucose contents spike to unatural levels, and this generates alot of stress on your body.\n\n1- Your organs and brain view this as a response to environmental dangers. When our ancestors had to fight or flee dangers, a natural response would be to liberate stocked glucose as a quick energy source to escape or fight. \n\nYet, there's no threat or dangers. So the high you feel, is just your brain absorbing tons of energy it didn't need or asked for.\n\nThis, creates addiction though. All the hormones released in your brain during this high will rapidly make your brain crave more sugar and the sweet dopamine it releases.\n\n2- Your pancreas, reacts quickly to the spike of glucose contents in the blood. It doesn't know why there is so much sugar, but it thinks that it needs to be absorbed, and very quickly. Probably thinking you need to run away from a wolve or something.\n\nThe probem though is that your pancreas isn't built for glucose spikes. Its role is to regulate insulin in the bloodstream over the day, not every hour. Consuming large quantities of sugar regularly will litterally break it. Thus developping symptoms of diabetes.\n\n3- with high insulin levels, the glucose is consummed very quickly, and your bloodstream will fall into glucose deficientcy. There aren't enough to provide energy to your brain, which is a big consumer. \n\nIt will take time before glucose level and insulin levels stabilize, and you'll feel this as a low.\n\nThat's pretty much it. I'd suggest you to avoid consuming products high in refined glucose. Instead favor natural sweets, or small doses of coffee if you crave the energy boost for driving.",

In some types of Poker some public cards are revealed, players can then make calculated decisions on what hands are possible, then bet accordingly. Other players then have to take into account both the hand possibilities *and the bet of the other player* when making their own decision. Taking into account the other player's behavior is the game theory aspect.\n\nSo say you have a straight, and you know from the public appearing cards you have the second best possible hand, but there is a low statistical liklihood that the other player has the better hand. The other player bets first and places a *huge* wager. Now you have to weigh the low statistical liklihood that they have the better hand against their behavior. Are they bluffing to get you to fold and lose? You may have a better idea of this if you've studied their tendencies and play styles from previous games.\n\nNow obviously you can expand this to basically all human interactions where there is some winner and some loser. The best approach to take has to take into account the other person's agency and decision making while navigating the interaction.

So they both lose out.\n\nThere's 4 possible states:\n\n1. Both advertise, they each lose 100 million, but stay equal.  \n2.

So it is useful when there are either agreed upon rules (i.e. you roll this die, and if it's a 6, I can slap you, then I roll the die)  or natural consequences (shoot this revolver at your head, there is only 1 bullet in the 6 chambers, if it doesn't go off, then I'll shoot it at my head).\n\nGame theory is a way of mapping out or otherwise understanding the decisions that are made and their consequences, and this being able to make the best possible decision in a given situation.\n\n+ Does game theory require everyone to be logical, as suggested by another answer?\n    + No. Game theory works no matter how other people make their decisions. Knowing whether other people make decisions logically or not can help YOU make decisions, but game theory works regardless of how other people make decisions.

But if space is infinite and every line of sight should terminate in a star, why aren’t there enough stars to flood the whole night sky with light?\n\nThe answer is inflation. Space is moving apart fast enough that the light from more distant stars hasn’t had and in fact will never have enough time to reach us.

Steel and glass construction methods use a strong center stack (a \"spine\" if you will) and everything else just kind of hangs from that.

We make bicycles in the U.S., and they make bicycles in China. For various reasons, the Chinese can make bicycles super cheap. So cheap that, even when you factor in the cost of shipping, they can sell them in the U.S. for less than what it costs an American factory to make them. Consumers will obviously want to buy the much cheaper Chinese bikes and the American factories can’t compete. That will close down the American factories and cost American jobs. \n\nSo what the American government can do is charge a tax on bicycles made in China. This tax is paid by the importers, but what it does is effectively raise the cost of the bike, which in turn raises the selling price. This means the Chinese bikes will now be priced closer to what the American bikes are priced at, and there’s a more balanced competition. We could also charge a tariff so high that the Chinese bikes are way *more* expensive than the American bikes, and that would guarantee victory for the American factories. \n\nWhich all sounds great. So why not do that all the time? Well, if we can charge import taxes on Chinese goods, then the Chinese can charge import taxes on American goods. And if we shut the Chinese out of the American market, then that’s just what they’ll do in retaliation. Which is a problem, because the Chinese market is *huge*. China has about four times the population of America, so while American businesses will do well at home it would be a disaster for international sales. \n\nTariffs are an important tool in the toolkit of international trade, but they have to be deployed smartly.

They are a neutral thing, buy can be a good thing depending on what you want to happen.\n\nThe end result, ultimately, is that imported goods are more expensive than domestic goods.\n\nSay you cared about pollution. Which is greener: Building a product locally where you have strict pollution controls, or building it where you can dump your toxic runoff into the local reservoir, burn all your waste, and then send it by ship to your green country? Once you make it more expensive to pollute, most companies stop polluting.\n\nSay you cared about jobs. Can everyone be a doctor/lawyer/computer programmer? Of course not, as some people just aren't smart enough to do these jobs, others don't think in the proper way to do these jobs, others don't have the temperament for these jobs, and still others just don't want to do these jobs. Does that mean if you can't or won't do these jobs you deserve death or exile? Because in a globalized economy that is literally the case. You either starve to death because you are unfit for the only jobs available in your home country or those jobs do not pay a living wage, or you move to another country where you know no one, are not familiar with the culture, but the jobs you are fit for are now there and you just have to accept the standard of living we as a global society deemed is fit for those jobs. By forcing those jobs back to your home country you force those jobs back into your home country's standard of living and wages fit for your country.\n\nSay you cared about taxing the billionaires. By forcing companies to have a presence in your country you make sure you are taxing their revenue and expense streams. You get a cut of all profits made within the company and get to collect payroll tax on every person who is employed by the company that works in your country. That is millions of dollars repatriated and taxed to fund your government.\n\nTariffs also tend to not effect the poor and focus more on the wealthy. Yes, people rich or poor purchase imported goods. However poor people are more likely to purchase goods used than wealthier people. Since Tariffs are paid at import, and the cost passed on only to the first point of sale, this means buying a used imported good is tariff free. You may not be able to keep buying your cheap Chinese plastic crap, but you can buy French or German crap used and end up with better quality. And cheap American plastic crap is always an option. \n\nJust remember, arguing for no Tariffs is arguing for the right to pay the third world slave wages to make your cheap plastic crap. It isn't honorable. It isn't enriching the host country of Black and Decker to make cheap drills and pollute the country while paying the people crap and flipping off safety standards that a lemonade stand here wouldn't even abide by.",

Tariffs really only work well when you want to move big industries that assemble final products (say, putting a tariff on Lockheed-Martin aircraft, but not any of the components that go into the aircraft). They are also useful in \"tariff-wars\" which basically entails playing chicken with another economy to get them to lower their tariffs by imposing key tariffs of your own. However, the entire purpose of these tariffs is to eventually get rid of the tariffs. Putting a 50-500% tariff (as has been suggested) is just a bad idea straight-up. The thing that isn't being considered is that many countries don't have the capability to suddenly start producing a product in a different place. Say your country wants to produce spaceships domestically, but there is no cheap land to build a plant on, and no companies that have the investors/capital required to build a spaceship factory, then adding a tariff will only make spaceships more expensive, because the startup required to begin domestic production isn't there, and by placing a tariff on the goods, especially the components, it makes it harder to even try to build it in the first place. That's an intentionally ludicrous example, but I think it gets the point across.\n\nThese kinds of things could also be potentially helpful if there is a job market crash and everyone is unemployed. However, if unemployment rates are very low, making more manufacturing jobs doesn't really help all that much. I think there's a balance where basically you want to steadily increase the amount of jobs that are available at a reasonable rate similar to net growth of the population. If you grow or shrink the market too fast, then you see places understaffed and potentially going out of business or heavily overstaffed, resulting in extremely high unemployment. So in that sense, if you have an industry that used to thrive domestically but is going under, resulting in layoffs due to foreign competition, then tariffs might be a good idea to save those industries.",

        "comment_body": "Since electronic votes are encrypted, the danger is that the voting device can, maliciously or otherwise, change the vote before encryption. However, checking the encrypted vote to ensure it matches breaks voter secrecy. Unfortunately there isn't a simple way around this.\n\nThe Benaloh Challenge describes a process in which how voters may gain confidence that their votes are cast as intended, while at the same time preserving the secrecy of the vote. It arises from a game-theoretic treatment of encrypted voting. There are two 'players' in this game: the voter and the encryption device. The voter obviously wants to make sure their vote is not altered, while the encryption device may be malicious and try to bias the cast vote, or it may be faulty and change the vote randomly.\n\nThe challenge is the process (simplified from [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03258) and [[2]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173750)):\n\n1. The voter fills in their ballot and passes it to the encryption device.\n2. The device encrypts the ballot. The device provides back to the voter some 'check-code' or a equivalent way which can be used to verify the encryption of the vote.\n3. The voter decides either to finalize and cast their ballot, in which case we finish, or verify (i.e. *challenge*) the encryption (step 4).\n4. If 'to verify' is chosen, the vote is, well, verified (in manner that is *trusted* by the voter) and the voter gets to see whether their choice and that of the encrypted ballot match. However, this spoils the vote and we go back to step 1 to repeat the process.\n\nThe voter can challenge the encryption as many times as desired, but once the ballot is cast, the process ends. Note here that this cast ballot is not verified by the voter (otherwise this would break secrecy), but the device does not know whether the voter will choose to cast the encrypted ballot or how many times the voter will choose to verify.\n\nIn game theory we want to examine how these two agents will act (assuming they only are concerned with their self interests) - how many times the voter will verify, how often a malicious encryption device may alter the vote, etc. There will be payoffs and costs defined for the voter and device which are used to determine each party's best course of action. The details of this are out of scope, but you can take a look at [1] if you're interested, or other threads for explanations of game theory in general.",

        "comment_body": "The Benaloh challenge is like a safety test for making sure an online voting system isn’t cheating. Let’s say Alice goes to vote on some untrusted machine. She picks her choices, and the machine turns her vote into a secret code so that no one can see who she voted for. But Alice wants to be sure the machine didn’t secretly change her vote when it coded it.\n\nTo prove that it’s being honest, the machine shows Alice a digital receipt (called a commitment) that represents her coded vote. This receipt doesn’t show the actual vote, just proof that it exists in coded form. At this point, Alice has two choices: she can either trust the machine and submit her vote, or she can test the machine to make sure it wasn’t lying. \n\nIf Alice chooses to test the machine (a challenge), the machine has to reveal the behind-the-scenes work it did—like the original marked ballot and random numbers it used to create the code. The vote then becomes invalid and has to be recomputed as all the secret numbers have been revealed (Alice has to re-enter the vote and can decide if the she wants to test the machine again or submit after getting a new commitment). But alice can then use a trusted device like her phone to check if these match the receipt. If they do, it means the machine didn’t change her vote and was honest. If not, the machine gets caught cheating. \n\nThe trick is that the machine never knows if Alice is going to submit her vote or challenge it until it’s already made the receipt. This makes it risky for the machine to cheat, because if it changes even a single vote, it might get caught if someone challenges it at that moment. The more people who challenge, the higher the chance that cheating will be exposed.",

Resistors are the slide itself, where they come back down and lose all that energy they gained.\n\n**Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law** is basically saying: “Hey, the total energy you spent climbing up (battery) equals the energy lost sliding down (resistors).” So by the end, you’re at ground level again, net change = zero.\n\nBut here’s the twist: kids are still sliding and climbing. The battery keeps lifting them up, energy keeps being used, and the current (kids) keep moving. Zero net voltage doesn’t mean no action; it means the energy supplied by the battery is fully used up around the loop. The battery pushes current around the circuit, keeping the flow going despite that zero sum.\n\nSo yeah, it’s a closed loop with continuous movement, powered by the battery pumping energy in and the resistors using it up.",

In the slide analogy, the voltage is the height difference between 2 points. Voltage isn't something that describes a circuit as a whole, just 2 points on the circuit. That's why voltmeters have to be attached at 2 different points to work. \n\nNow, Kirchoff's law is effectively stating \"for any point on the circuit, the voltage between that point and itself is 0\". It's not talking about between ends of the battery, or the circuit as a whole. There can be voltage between different points on the circuit, but the same point will have the same electric potential i.e. same height on the slide. \n\nThat should seem almost painfully obvious and pretty useless in isolation, if you're thinking the right way about what voltage means. The thing that makes it useful when analyzing circuits is that any path back to the same spot in the circuit has to get you back to the same electric potential/height on the slide. So you can use that to make inferences about the voltages between different spots on the circuit.\n\nOn a slide, a kid can do a lap around the slide, and when they get back to the spot, they're at the same height. They gained and lost energy through the process of climbing the ladder/ going down the slide, but they're at the same height when they get back to the same spot.

For a typical AA battery (1.5V, 2000-3000mAh) this is 10-15 kJ.\n\nEnergy is power multiplied by time, so the time a battery can sustain a certain power draw until it is fully drained is t = E / P.\n\nSubstituting P gives us t = E \\* R / U² .\n\nIf the circuit truly had 0 resistance (R=0) we get t=0, so the battery, regardless of its voltage and capacity, would be drained in literally no time at all. On the other hand, trying to calculate the power draw gives us a division by zero, so we know something's fishy about this calculation.\n\nOf course, in reality, every wire (and the battery itself) has a very small resistance, so the battery would only be drained in a *very short time*, with the wire having a *very high power draw* for that short time. Since no other kind of work is done (like turning a motor), all that energy is by default converted into heat, and since this happens over a very short time, the heat has no time to dissipate, and the battery and wire get very hot.

Real shorts always have a parasitic load of some sort, since wires and batteries have their own (small) resistance. The circuit diagram to represent a \"real\" battery looks more like [this](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Internal-Resistance-Battery.png) and the wire's own resistance would be added as an extra resistor between the + and - nodes.\n\nSo a real battery being shorted works more like a voltage source and two resistors, and you can calculate everything accordingly. You can even experimentally measure the internal resistance of the battery pretty easily. When the internal resistance of the battery has too much voltage drop, the battery heats up and becomes damaged, so batteries must always be sized large enough that their internal resistance doesn't cause problems. That's why a car's 12 volt battery is so damn big compared to a regular household 9 volt battery.

The exception are superconductors, but there you still have a resistance at the contact where the conductor is connected to the battery. The battery also has an internal resistance.\n\nSuperconductors are weird, and apparently they are indeed capable of having a current run through them indefinitely, even without any voltage applied because there is no voltage drop along any part of the superconductor. But since the battery is not made of superconductors, the entire voltage drop would fall on the battery's internal resistance and heat up the battery, probably to destructive effect.\n\nWhen calculating voltages and currents, we usually *pretend* the cables and wires and contacts have no resistance because they are very small compared to the motor or lamp or whatever we hook up to the battery. But that is a simplification that only works under certain circumstances. You are asking the results for a scenario where these circumstances aren't given, so you actually have to consider stuff like wire resistance that is usually ignored.",

I think it's awesome the way you're sparking this discussion and helping me go through the same exercises. \n\nAfter thinking on it a bit, I think it would help to turn the slide analogy into a water slide, where water moving corresponds to electric charge moving (i.e. current). Voltage is still height difference. \n\nImagine a situation in series, if the first slide had more water pouring in than the 2nd slide. You'd end up with a bunch of water piling up in between the two slides, which would quickly become unsustainable and unstable. Likewise, you don't want a bunch of electric charge piling up in your circuit. I don't have a better answer for \"why\" here, just that if it weren't that way, circuits would be pretty scary and unstable. And that stability probably means it's the lowest energy state, and electricity following the path of least resistance etc. \n\nIn any case, if the order of slides were reversed, with the 2nd slide pouring more water than is coming in, you'd quickly end up without enough water to keep pouring.\n\nFor the parallel case, the analogy kinda breaks down a bit and you have to pretend the height of different platforms on your slide can be affected by how much water/kids are coming down. Electricity follows the path of least resistance, and it's\"easier\" to go down a less crowded hallway where less electricity is going, so it just balances itself in a way that equalizes voltage?\n\nThis is pretty much at my limit of understanding why. Uni classes don't really incentivize getting caught up on such details, so I was more concerned with learning the practical details and getting through lab work. However, it's clear that you're learning for your own understanding through a natural curiosity that I could only dream of fostering. Please let me know if you end up with a better understanding! I doubt I have much more to share, but I'd love to know if you end up figuring out something that I don't know about this fascinating field of study. Best of luck, friend!",

        "comment_body": "The trick of the shock wave is that the air ahead of it is not affected by the bow wave of the aircraft.\n\nThink of a speedboat gradually getting faster.  At first it pushes a pile of water ahead of it.  This is a bow wave, from the boat moving the water aside.  It can be far ahead of the boat.  Now it goes faster, and can climb up on the bow wave.  The boat is moving as fast as the water shock wave can move.  Faster still, the boat now starts moving down the bow wave.  Essentially, it is surfing the wave, literally.  It can reduce power and let the wave push it along.  Profit!\n\nNow with air:  The airplane pushes it's way though the air, but the air ahead of the plane is affected by the approach because the particles bounce/shift at the speed of sound. (yes yes physics, give me a break).\n\nAs the plane approaches the speed of sound, you reach the point where the air can't adjust/shift ahead of the plane.  The plane hits the speed of sound and the air is effectively is a wall of stationary gas.  Think of a stone hitting the surface of a pond.  It goes thump, and that is where the boom starts -- compression.   This phase is very draggy for the aircraft and this was why it was called the sound barrier.\n\nNew designs allow better performance while passing through the sound barrier, most notably the wasp waist or coke-bottle design due to the Area Rule.  It's the aerial equivalent of tugboat vs speedboat design.\n\nAt any rate, the sonic shockwave itself is paper thin, consisting of uncompressed air ahead of the wave (normal, nothing happening air), the wave itself consisting of highly compressed air from the aircraft hitting it, and thirdly, the rapid expansion of the air BEHIND the shockwave, as it tries to return to normal atmosphere again.  It's the expansion, like a firecracker, that goes boom and is what you hear.\n\nFYI, the last part about rapid expansion it what gave aircraft like the WW II P-38 fits when diving over 350 mph.  The air around the upper part of the wing was forming a shock wave, but not under the wing (as much).  So the expanding air behind the wave was hitting the underside of the tail and forcing the nose down.  Why the underside?  The region between the back edge of the wing and tail was downward flow (lifting the plane), and that's where the expanding air went.  \n\nThus the poor pilot in a fight trying to dive to attack (or escape) found themselves in an outside loop and unable to manhandle the elevator upwards to pull out of it.  Much hilarity did not ensue!",

The Salem trials were decades after most other places had stopped having witchcraft trials, and they killed 19 people in a very short space of time. (Also to my knowledge it WAS the last witchcraft trial in America where anyone was actually executed).  When word got out to other nearby towns what they'd been up to in Salem, people thought they had gone NUTS. A fair number of people at the time were skeptical about witchcraft in general... The majority of people probably believed in it in the sense of \"it's in the bible so I assume they're out there somewhere but it's not something I worry about much,\" but definitely not in the \"witches walk among us and must be rooted out\" sense.

Some girls were removed and sent to relatives in other towns, and magically their afflictions stopped, until they returned to the ring in Salem/Danvers.\n\nIt was essentially a property grab disguised as a religious persecution.\n\nThere are great books on Salem, covering even things like micro aggressions towards the newest pastor via his firewood allotments that just built up a powder keg for a small community to turn on itself.",

There's also deeper problems, like telomere shortening and cellular senescence (poorly functioning cells aren't replaced, but aren't doing their \"work\", either) and poisoning from oxygen (yep, the one thing we need to live is also toxic to us), but that's all working together to damage your function and looks.\n\nOver a long lifetime (about 130 years by design, but lifestyle, air quality and diet changes this to less), this damage accumulates, so critical cells to your organs, like heart, kidneys or liver are restored in bad state as well, so you get \"natural death\" which in most times is organ failure.\n\nBasically, human body is like an aging chef with dementia. The longer they work, the more they forget how to make this or that dish. Mistakes accumulate. Until they mess up food so bad they get fired (human dies).",

This attack is not only done by antiboies, but also by increased bloodflow, and swelling. \n\nWhat happens in aseptic inflamation is, the body produces things that the immune system doesn't recognise, and so your own body will be attacked. It's a sort of natural, age related autoimmune response.  Basically, DNA is suposed to be in the nucleus, and if  there is DNA in the cytoplasm it usually is viral in origin. However, some parts of your own DNA (which are actually ancient viruses) do result in cytoplasmic DNA, and this is more common in old age. The underlying mechanism there is, these viral originating DNA fragments are usefull in evolution but harmfull to the individual, so they are silenced epigenetically. But with time, epigenetic silencing is lost just due to random error mostly. And then these viral fragments (transposons) activate, resulting in cytoplasmic DNA, and causing inflammation all over the body.",

This is a relatively easy system for a currency but becomes complicated when you start dealing with large sums of money or travel long distances because you have to carry a lot of precious metals around all the time.\nTo combat this problem people started to use promissory notes. Instead of giving someone a few kilograms of silver you give them a piece of paper that allows them to withdraw the amount of silver from your bank account. You can also trade a promissory note to someone else to avoid going to the bank.\nAt some point governments realized they could abuse the system to spend more money than they had at the moment because people would just trade their promissory notes further and further instead of getting the precious metals and that's how paper money became a thing. \nCoins stayed in use for small amounts because it is easier to carry a few coins than write checks for every purchase.",

How much has that single coin acquired as an effective value because of the amount of transactions it was involved in over that time? If it paid off its own manufacturing after 2 months, how many coins has it paid off the manufacturing of after over 600 months?",

It is made of amino acids and your body can't make all of them on it's own, so you need to eat them.\n\nThe recommended minimum amount of protein for a healthy diet is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day.  This is used to maintain your body and to repair and rebuild it.\n\nIf you are an active person and causing increased damage to your muscles by using them more, or want to build more muscle, you will need more building material, which means eating more protein.\n\nKeep in mind that not all the protein you eat gets proceed into your body perfectly, so if you want to put on 100g of muscle you will need to eat more than 100g of protein.  The protein also gets used for energy so it may not get used to repair muscle at all if you haven't eaten enough calories.\n\nSo you should be making sure to get adequate protein to stay healthy otherwise your body can't repair itself.\n\nA diet filled with a variety of whole foods should easily meet the protein needs. If you are on a restricted diet, or are concerned you might not be meeting your needs, then you should measure your food and calculate the protein intake to see how close you are.\n\nThe recommended amount of protein to eat per day, measured in 'grams of protein per kilogram of body weight' is;\n\n0.8g for normal individuals.\n\n1g - 1.2g for elderly or physically active people.\n\n1.2g - 2g for very active people such as athletes, or if your activity is designed for muscle growth like a bodybuilder.\n\nOther than being expensive, excess protein can also have some negative effects, so don't go too far over the recommended amounts either.\n\nedit: It also doesn't need to be every day.  For normal people having more one day and less another is okay, as long as it averages out.  However if you are a bodybuilder or physically active you should try to be more consistent.  Because your body cannot store protein very well, and it needs time to repair itself, you will slow down your recovery if it does not have access to the protein is needs.  This doesn't mean you need to space it out perfectly, just don't try to eat none for a whole day and then double it the next day.",

This did not mean people got frisky with these animals: the vast majority of these diseases we acquired from eating the infected meat or getting inflected animal blood into scrapes and cuts.\n\n\nHerpes type 2 (\"genital herpes\" but can also cause cold sores) is a close relative of gorilla herpes, which scientists thought we acquired hundreds of thousands of years ago when an early human scavenged a gorilla carcass.\n\n\nHIV came from the early to mid 20th century from people cut themselves while cutting into a chimp carcass and getting infected chimp blood into the cuts. Their equivalent, SIV is a minor inconvenience to them, but it's lethal to us.\n\n\nChlamydia my have come from handling infected meat of any of the thousands of animal species that host one of the different species and strains of Chlamydia bacteria, including ruminants, poultry, cats, swine, etc. Most strains cause lung and eye infections, so the jump to an STI in humans is still a bit of a mystery.\n\n\nSyphilis has a similar story as Chlamydia: there are similar diseases floating around in other livestock animals like cows, although most are regular diseases and aren't STIs in these other species.",

HIV almost certainly came from a similar virus, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, which was transmitted to humans through bush hunters slaughtering monkeys for food. The hunter cuts themselves while slicing up the meat, or they got bitten while killing the monkey, or whatever...there's a fresh, open wound and the hunter gets blood from an infected monkey into his own wound, and the disease gets transferred that way.\n\nSome STIs are ancient. Herpes I is so old that humans have had it since before we were human. It evolved with us, and its origin is so old that no one knows for sure how it evolved. All we know is that our ancient ancestors already had it long before Homo sapiens existed. Herpes II is almost as old and came from close relatives. It may have come from sexual contact, but again this was before Homo sapiens existed as a species - it wasn't humans have sex with monkeys, it was our primate ancestors having sex with monkey primate ancestors.\n\nScabies also probably evolved with us and have been with us since before Homo sapiens existed. They evolved from body lice.\n\nAll of the STIs came from one of those two sources: it evolved with us as a species from some exposure long before humans existed; or, there was some other kind of exposure, probably blood contact from fighting or hunting.",

        "comment_body": "Asking how to imagine a TCP/IP packet on a wire is sort of like asking how you can imagine a word on paper.  How does a word look in its physical state?\n\nWell, the word could be written in pen or pencil or marker or crayon.  The word could be printed, or in cursive.  The word could be hand-written, or created by a typewriter, or a computer.  The word might not exist on paper at all, it might be on a blackboard, whiteboard, computer monitor, or movie screen.\n\nA word can be written many different ways.  The idea of \"a word\" and the physical implementation of \"how is it written\" are at different *layers*.\n\nLikewise, a TCP/IP packet can be sent many different ways.  The idea of a \"TCP/IP packet\" and the physical implementation of \"how is it sent through a wire\" are at different layers.  (Several different layers of computer networking concepts [are named](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model):  TCP exists at the \"transport layer,\" IP exists at the \"network layer,\" and electricity in wires is the \"physical layer.\")\n\nIn a copper wire a packet will be electrical pulses.  In a fiber optic cable, a packet will be light pulses.  In a wifi network, a packet will be radio waves.\n\nElectronics Youtuber Ben Eater has a [video where he hooks up an Ethernet cable to an oscilloscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8CmibhvZ0c), so you can see the electrical pulses sending data.  This might be the closest to what you are asking about.\n\nWhen they designed TCP/IP, people were already connecting computers together.  Those existing networks used different kinds of wires.  The designers of TCP/IP consciously chose to make TCP/IP able to interconnect all kinds of different networks.\n\nIf you *inter*-connect different *net*-works, they form a bigger network.  You might call that bigger network an inter-network, or inter-net, for short.  The people who made inter-nets kept inter-connecting their inter-nets to each other.  Eventually most of the world's computers were on a single, very large inter-net, which we simply call The Internet.",

Campaign spending usually correlates well to a candidate's chances for victory, and companies are now allowed to donate as much as they feel is needed. When your candidate knows 40% of their success depends on your donation, they tend to tip a sympathetic ear. Why risk jail time trying to buy the votes of thousands of voters when, for the same amount of money, you can legally buy 4 or 5 state senators and get better service?

        "comment_body": "Since we've been exploring Mars rather closely for a while now we've learned a lot of things that could indicate life in the past or present.\n\n Firstly, it was thought that Mars only had ice and that if it ever had water it was probably not a lot of it, frozen, or otherwise unsuitable for life.\n\n But we're finding water on Mars now! It's deep ground water, but still. We've also found geological signs that could indicate rivers. So not just deep underground puddles, ice, or stale caves. But flowing water in plenty at some point.\n\n In these rivers we've also found organic compounds in large variety. In chemistry that just means compounds with carbon in them and they can form without life, but it shows that these rivers probably had all the materials needed for life to exist in them.\n\n And once life forms in the hospitable places it might well be the case that it sticks around in the lrxz hospitable places. We see this on Earth all the times, with life somehow not sticking around but thriving in all sorts of places. Like boiling hot volcanic vents at the bottom of the sea that are also incredibly toxic. In incredibly salty and cold environments. Deep underground in wet silt or frozen under thousands of tonnes of ice bacteria can still stick around for thousands of years.\n\n But we haven't found any clear proof of life, past or present. So these are arguments experts and scientists are having. You can easily find tonnes of scientific journals and NASA publications about it if you search for water on Mars or life on Mars.\n\n One of the big questions is that we don't know how likely life is to happen at all. Even under good conditions (such as nutrient rich rivers). We're missing pieces for how it started on Earth too, so it's hard to speculate. Mars is now considered to be likely to have been able to host life in the part. Plausibly some could stuck around, but it'd probably be bacteria or something like it. But how likely life is is still up in the air, and part of the reason we want to explore more. If life happened on Mars too, then it is far more likely that life often happens if the conditions are right, which would make the Fermi paradox enjoyer worried. Or panspermia.",

To my knowledge, fair use is when you get someone else’s work, and you transform it into something else or so that it has a different purpose. Isn’t that what sampling does? You’re getting a small snippet of someone else’s music/voice, typically it’s sped up or slowed down, and of course you’re usually rapping over it. That sounds like transforming to me.

        "comment_body": "Couple things: First, fair use is a lot more complicated than your explanation. There are four factors, including whether the unauthorized use is commercial and whether it has an effect on the market for the original. Check out the statute, it's 17 USC 107. You're invoking a version of the idea of \"transformativeness\" that is part (but not all) of the factor one analysis. Even then, that idea (which is itself a judicial gloss on the statute that may have been rolled back a bit by the recent Warhol decision) looks to transforming the purpose of the owner's work, and making one pop track into another pop track is pretty much the same purpose. If you're sampling, for example, a voice over from the news maybe you have a better argument.\n\nSecond, sampling entails making a direct reproduction of an owner's sound recording, not just the musical composition that underlies it. Because that is a verbatim copy, many courts have been unsympathetic because it is not a transformation but just a transposition of the work. If sampling entailed modifying the sound recording, this might come out differently. But then it wouldn't be sampling.\n\nFinal point, I don't like how copyright law interacts with the practice of sampling. My sense is that it makes it too risky and deters creativity. I'd like to see something like a compulsory license system for samples. But under the law the way we have it now, it's a lot more complicated than invoking some casual idea of transformation.",
